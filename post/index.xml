      <title>Restore EdgeRouter USB drive</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter PoE since several years now and really like it. Fanless, small, running on Debian (unfortunately not really up to date) and powerful.
However I recently had issues with the disk. Simply dead and obviously a reboot didn&amp;rsquo;t repaired it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching solutions on the official forum to replace the disk and I was surprised about the fact it runs on a simple USB stick. I decided to replace it with a Kingston one:</description>

      <title>Bye bye Mediawiki</title>

      <description>After more than 10 years using my beloved Mediawiki (wiki.deimos.fr), I decided to convert it into static html files and stop using Mediawiki :(.
Why? Because maintaining a Mediawiki is a pain when you&amp;rsquo;re using a lot of extensions. In addition, I&amp;rsquo;m not using Mediawiki anymore at work, not really following the evolution, don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep maintaining php/mariadb/nginx and upgrading Mediawiki configuration can be complex as well.
I really love markdown solutions generating static files like Hugo and I already did it whith my previous Wordpress.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an amateur photographer and I&amp;rsquo;m using an Olympus E-M1 Mark II camera. I take photos in RAW mode to be able. For those who know me, my computer is running on Linux and I&amp;rsquo;m using Geeqie to display RAW picture. It&amp;rsquo;s a very fast and powerful solution to display them.
In addition of displaying them quickly, it enhances the look and I really appreciate the rendering. Here is the original image (the first one) and the redered one by Geeqie (the second one):</description>

      <description>For my own company MySocialApp, I&amp;rsquo;m managing multiple Cassandra clusters on top of a Kubernetes on premise cluster. For those who never heard of this distributed database, here is the summary from the official website:
 The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Kubernetes on an on premise cluster for MySocialApp. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m storing MySocialApp public images at Quay.io and I also wanted to store private images. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bootstrap a private registry for it to avoid maintaining it, having a distributed storage to maintain for it etc&amp;hellip;but wanted a solution at a lower cost.
I started to look at DockerHub and Quay.io. As far aas I saw, DockerHub do not provide private registry while Quay does.</description>

      <description>The Jeedom software is open source; you have complete access to the software that manages your home automation. Jeedom is compatible with various protocols, like Z-Wave, RFXCOM, RTS SOMFY, EnOcean, xPL, etc.
Installing Jeedom on Synology with Docker it not a complex task. However for those who are not familiar with those technologies, I summarized here the installation process for a Z-wave network.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the requirements:</description>

      <description>Traefik (pronounced like traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. It supports several backends (Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes, Marathon, Mesos, Consul, Etcd, Zookeeper, BoltDB, Eureka, Amazon DynamoDB, Rest API, file…) to manage its configuration automatically and dynamically.
In a previous post, I explained how to manually deploy it in HA mode. For MySocialApp (iOS and Android social app builder - SaaS), I had to automate it.</description>

      <description>If you follow me, you may know that I launched with friends Nousmotards social application a few years ago. The solution continue to grow in France with more than 70k bikers and that&amp;rsquo;s a good point for all those riders :)
Since we launched Nousmotards, several persons asked us: &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ve made an amazing job for bikers, do you provide your social solution to any other communities or for enterprises?&amp;rdquo;. The answer was: No we didn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

I wanted to deploy it on Kubernetes for its interesting features like:
 Connect to Kubernetes API to listen changes and perform on the fly updates Automatic SSL management through Let&amp;rsquo;s encrypt (SNI) Prometheus native integration HTTP/2 support  I really like HAProxy, but in a Kubernetes case, it&amp;rsquo;s not the recommended solution because of its lake of features.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. I&amp;rsquo;m using it for Nousmotards and decided to build an Ansible role for it to make it simpler to deploy.
Why did I built it as other projects like Kargo already exists? I just wanted a simple and maintainable role based on CoreOS official documentation. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did:
 This role bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster based on CoreOS Container Linux for production usages.</description>

      <description>As you certainly seen, the blog has been migrated :-). Visualy there is a big change and technically it&amp;rsquo;s the same.
I was fed up about maintaining Wordpress with its stack (Nginx / php-fpm / MariaDB) for a mostly static blog. I was thinking about migrating from Wordpress to something in markdown since several years but didn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly which solution I wanted to choose. I really enjoyed using Wordpress but wanted to keep hands on my blog and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to switch to full hosted Wordpress because of its limitations (image size etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
CoreOS is a lightweight Linux operating system designed for clustered deployments providing automation, security, and scalability for your most critical applications.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with CoreOS to replace Debian hosts which run Docker containers on Nousmotards project. CoreOS helps on simplifying bare metal deployment and avoid managing OS upgrade.
As I&amp;rsquo;m still an Ansible lover, I&amp;rsquo;ve made 2 roles:
 CoreOS Ansible:&amp;nbsp;Ansible role to deploy pypy to CoreOS to be able to get Ansible prerequisites CoreOS: Ansible CoreOS role to deploy CoreOS on bare metal servers  If you want to quickly look at the result:</description>

      <description>Long time since my last post. This one is not very technical post, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice to have solution if you use grep usually. Are not you fed up to type vim  and search the line after a grep command ? If yes, this post is for you.
First of all, you may know that an alternative more user friendly to grep exist, called ag (perf comparison). I really like ag and grep, but something make me loose my time since several years and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s your case too.</description>

      <description>Some of you may not be familiar with the terms &amp;ldquo;Rolling upgrade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Rolling restart&amp;rdquo;. This is the action of upgrading or restarting a cluster without service interruption (alias zero downtime). In most cases, this is done node by node, but in fact it depends of the technology you&amp;rsquo;re managing and the number of active nodes in your cluster.
At Nousmotards we have several Java Spring Boot applications running. Restarting one application can take up to 1 min.</description>

In my previous post, I talked about how to speed up reads and writes coupling Redis with Neo4J. Now I want to share with you how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to unload your server and use Elasticsearch to speed up news feed and user wall.

      <description>Neo4J is the most popular graph database in the NoSQL databases family. We&amp;rsquo;re using it in the Nousmotards project to store all social data through nodes and relationships.
Today I am going to talk about our experience after having using it for 2 years now (take a look at directed graph if you are not really familiar with Graph Database).

      <description>This title can sounds like a troll, but this is not the case! I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as a feedback. When I spoke during an Ansible meetup presenting Nousmotards infrastructure, I had several questions regarding why I chose monit as the init system instead of supervisord. That&amp;rsquo;s what encouraged me to write this post and that&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to clarify here the things.

A few days ago, I wanted to try Graphite events to get something pretty cool in Grafana :
This to be able to know when a new app version is deployed and make it easier to understand when an issue occurs.</description>

      <description>Hi all ! Long time since last blog post ! I&amp;rsquo;m using Jenkins with Ansible on my Nousmotards project for building docker containers or deploying into production.
You may noticed that you&amp;rsquo;ve no Ansible color when running it into Jenkins! The simple way to correct it is to export an environment variable in your Jenkins job:
export ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true Now that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool! However, you may also noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s some kind of lags on the console when you want to see a real time console log on Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Debian 8 is out ! After several months of freeze, it&amp;rsquo;s now ready. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about that version because MySecureShell is finally available in the mainstream packages and the second thing is MariaDB available in the latest stable version (10).
Unfortunately, Docker is not present because it has too fast cycles to be stable (source). Thanks to Debian teams for this amazing work once again :-)</description>

      <description>Un blog post en français cette fois ci, car ça ne concerne que les Français (pour l&amp;rsquo;instant) pour vous expliquer le nouveau projet que j’entreprends avec 2 amis. L&amp;rsquo;idée est simple, vous êtes motards, vous aimez les balades à moto&amp;hellip;l&amp;rsquo;application est faites pour vous !
Aucune application n&amp;rsquo;est à l&amp;rsquo;heure actuelle disponible sur Smartphone qui fait ce que nous proposons. Il s&amp;rsquo;agit d&amp;rsquo;une application à la Facebook like, ou vous pouvez inviter des amis, créer des clubs de moto, proposer et planifier des itinéraires, partager vos parcours effectués et beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;autres choses.</description>

      <description>For a new project (will talk about it later), I needed to use Neo4J (graph database if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet).
I tried to cover more features than the current existing Ansible roles available on Ansible Galaxy. More will come in the next weeks. I also tried to make it simple to install it and do not force dependencies at maximum. Here are parameters you can set:
# Select neo4j version neo4j_package: neo4j # community version #neo4j_package: neo4j-advanced #neo4j_package: neo4j-enterprise  # Neo4j spatial plugin neo4j_install_spatial: false neo4j_spatial_version: &amp;#39;0.</description>

      <description>Since several weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m playing a lot with Debian Jessie as a server. I discovered some bugs, reported them to Debian, they&amp;rsquo;ve been fixed etc&amp;hellip;good news! I also wanted to test the new version of LXC.
So I decided to upgrade my 2 personal servers to Jessie. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so easy with Systemd. I still encounter non critical issues and going to prepare report bugs for Debian (cgroups issues with systemd).</description>

      <description>For another personal project (that I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about for the moment ;-)), I wanted to have a Changelog file to get a better following of the infrastructure evolution (configuration management, scripts&amp;hellip;all under git). Of course the documentation is very important, but when you do not write it at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re building the infrastructure, it may be complex to remember each little things you&amp;rsquo;ve done. That&amp;rsquo;s why a Changelog can help to understand how the infrastructure has been built step by step.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I wanted to play with HAProxy SSL offloading. It was a good experience and alternative to Nginx SSL offloading (I already talked about in this blog). But this is not the topic here&amp;hellip;
When I was trying to make the offload working on the blog, I modified WordPress options which switched my blog into an infinite loop mode. As it was late and I was tired (bad idea), I just wanted to rollback my changes and needed to recover a SQL backup to do it fast.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I already talked about offloading SSL with Nginx. I also wanted to try it with HAProxy which can be more interesting in some cases.
The good On HAProxy, the good thing is the simplicity to do it. First of all you need to have at least the version 1.5 of HAProxy so to get SSL support. Then you only need those lines to offload SSL:</description>

      <description>Packer is a really great solution to make an image in several formats (VirtualBox, Docker&amp;hellip;). I recently wanted to deploy it on a Jenkins server to automatically perform image build with the help of Packer.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a Packer role for Ansible really easy to use. You simply have to set (or let them by defaults) vars:
# Packer version to install packer_version: &amp;#39;0.7.5&amp;#39; # Packer destination folder packer_destination: &amp;#39;/usr/bin&amp;#39; It will install the desired version :-)</description>

      <description>For my company, I recently had to find a good solution to make Snapshots from Instance IDs or from tags on AWS. I made several searches but unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I was searching for.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to make a tool to do this kind of job. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python and requires the Boto library. Here is what you can do with Simple EC2 snapshots:
 Hot snapshots (by default) and Cold snapshots   Multiple instances snapshot in one line   Detection of doubles   Filters by tags (allowing wildcards) or by instance IDs   Credentials file multiple with profiles   Limit the number of snapshots   Restrict snapshots to data disks only   The tool is open source and can be downloaded on GitHub :-).</description>

      <description>Packer is one of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to build VirtualBox boxes. You can find what I&amp;rsquo;ve done on my GitHub account.
For Smash project, I wanted to make a packer configuration to manage Docker and VirtualBox. I also wanted to call Ansible to build specific images for each needs. The goal is to be able to build cloud image ready to start, without any special dependencies. This because I need different usages:</description>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about how to manage Docker and VirtualBox with Vagrant. This post follows the last one, with the integration of Ansible as a provisioner. Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m using it for the Smash project.
With Ansible, I made several &amp;ldquo;group_vars&amp;rdquo; files containing custom and common information related to the used environment (dev, uat, staging&amp;hellip;). This helps to setup different kind of environment easily. Vagrant will help to build images with Ansible deployed inside.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m using Vagrant for more than a year now with VirtualBox. Docker is a faster alternative that needs to be taken into consideration. Having the possibility to manage both of them with the same tool can be very interesting. For information, I mainly use it with VirtualBox because it&amp;rsquo;s any platform compatible and Docker because it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for a CI like Jenkins.
I recently talked about my implication into the Smash project.</description>

So many solutions already exists today, but this one is a little bit different in my opinion, that&amp;rsquo;s why I accepted to take part of the adventure.
This solution is interesting because you&amp;rsquo;re anonymous. This can help you a lot if you&amp;rsquo;re shy. This kind of Phone application would help me a lot in the past if it was existing !</description>

I first wanted to try to contribute to an existing one. But I needed to have them quickly and unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do it.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I made 2 new Ansible roles and added them to Ansible Galaxy.</description>

It happened to me when I had to manage several playbook roles. I first wanted to use Git submodules to do it. However I preferred to search another way to do like like Puppet can do with R10K because I am working on a project with some unfamiliar Git users.</description>

ElasticSearch 1.4 version is ,out which doesn&amp;rsquo;t changed anything for the deployment. However Kibana requires to enable an ElasticSearch configuration option now, to work properly. I updated the Kibana playbook for it.
On its side, Fluentd has the major release 2.0 out and I updated Ansible playbook for the best integration with Debian Wheezy.</description>

git commit --amend However, modifying the date is not so common. You may want to do it for several reasons (stats or similar), here is how to:
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=&amp;#34;`date`&amp;#34; git commit --amend --date &amp;#34;`date`&amp;#34; This will change the last commit with the current date.</description>

      <description>First of all I will only talk about open sources solutions. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take part of any commercial one. In addition, I will focus on only 4 solutions which seem to me the most used at this time. I will also talk about my history, my level on each one and why I recommend or not that solution.
Puppet is in my opinion the most known solution. Because of the marketing they were/are doing, because it was a good alternative compared to the old cfengine.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s starting to be harder and harder to write good articles every 2 days. Some of you tell me that I should make less blog posts with better quality. However others tell me that they don&amp;rsquo;t care about quality because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned something anyway.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make this choice by my own and prefer let this to you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy if you could answer to this poll:</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you already had to tcpdump on a remote server to investigate. When you have a lot of traffic, it can start to be painful to add a lot filter, having no colors, reading tcpdump row format etc&amp;hellip; And most of the time Wireshark can help on having a better visibility on what happens.</description>

  targeted fixes for release critical bugs (i.e., bugs of severity critical, grave, and serious) in all packages (applies during the entire freeze (ok for TPU));
  fixes for severity: important bugs in packages of priority: optional or extra, only when this can be done via unstable (until the 5th of December 2014);</description>

      <description>As I do not really have a good blog post for today, here are some things I wanted to talk in a summary. Some good projects have been updated like:
 WordPress 4: no big updates at the first view but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see how this project works and grow (videos, WYSIWYG,&amp;hellip;) HAProxy 1.5: Offlloading SSL embedded, Full HTTP Keepalive, ACL enhancement&amp;hellip; BIG update! MySecureShell 2.0: Using GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL, available in Debian upstream repositories, new doc&amp;hellip; Nginx 1.</description>

      <description>I finally took the decision to close my both Facebook accounts. Why? You may red other kind of blog posts around that subject so I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat the same thing but I&amp;rsquo;ll resume in short sentences why I did it.
First you need to know why I had 2 Facebook accounts. The first one was my personal account with friends etc&amp;hellip;the problem is, all information I added on my account are the property of Facebook.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I played with Synology Photo Station and AWS Glacier. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t convinced me a lot and I wanted to find a better alternative.
And here is the one I&amp;rsquo;m going to use called Lychee. It&amp;rsquo;s a PHP based solution available on GitHub.
I really like that solution which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of features, but enough to be used for personal usage and for family.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/10/30/automatic-package-creation-which-one-to-choose/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing a complete packaging stack based on Docker to easily make different kind of packages for several Linux distributions. This for MySecureShell project.
This stack will be used to build packages in destination of upstream Linux distribution packages. But I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a simpler and faster way to create custom repositories mainly for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Fedora. In addition if packages could be automatically created when a new tag is pushed to the GitHub account, it would be perfect.</description>

      <description>You may know that I&amp;rsquo;m one of the 2 founders of MySecureShell. Around 6 years ago, we made a quick try to send MySecureShell to Debian and didn&amp;rsquo;t make enough efforts to make it possible.
This time I worked hard to make this happen. Thanks a lot to Gonéri Le bouder, a colleague and Debian dev to make it possible and helped me to do it fast, before Jessie freeze.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/10/26/finally-switching-back-to-ios-from-android/</guid>
      <description>In previous posts, I talked about why I switched from iOS to Android.
After 1 year and a half, after 3 different Android phones (Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S5), I&amp;rsquo;m finally going to switch back to iOS. For several reasons in facts but the major ones are those:
 Application quality lower than on iOS Lower global stability on Samsung Touchwizz and Cyanogen  I was pretty happy with Google Stock ROM, however it&amp;rsquo;s not available on all devices and the Nexus do not have the better hardware (not talking about Nexus 6).</description>

      <description>Merging from one branch to another branch is something common with Git. I had to do it several times and recently I had to make a big one. I&amp;rsquo;ve just never took the time to look at what exist to make faster merge and how to use it.
After some researches, I found git mergetool which will use VIM (by default on my laptop) to have a better view on what I have to do, to merge my files.</description>

      <description>You may upgrade your Mac OS X version to Yosemite (10.10) and saw you dual boot with Linux not working anymore :-(.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Apple made changes and Refind is not yet ready for it. So here is the solution to get your dual boot half back. It won&amp;rsquo;t fully work as expected, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to boot to Linux with Refind and Mac OS X with the alt key.</description>

      <description>I recently had a gift, this is a connected strap, the Jawbone UP24 model. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of things, but what it does works well.
I wanted one with a good autonomy. And a recent firmware update grew from 7 days to 14 the number of days the battery autonomy. I also wanted a strap able to give me information on night I&amp;rsquo;ve spent, doesn&amp;rsquo;t let me sleep all the afternoon during a siesta.</description>

      <description>A colleague talked to me about this tool this week and I felt in love. It helps to easily navigate into your git repository. You can have a look on last log and directly in the same interface the diff of the current commit. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached one screenshot to let you see how cool it is.
The are also a lot of other features but just for browsing purpose. You can&amp;rsquo;t update or make changes.</description>

      <description>Fig is a fast, isolated development environments using Docker. For some features, it can be compared to Vagrant where the Dockerfike is not enough powerful to build multiple instances.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to test a new product version of a software like MediaWiki and you want to build the complete stack. So you may need to have several tools categories (depending of the usage):
 Web: Nginx, PHP-FPM, Varnish App Cahing: Redis Search: ElasticSearch  In Vagrant you can natively build 3 VM and interconnect them without the need of additional tool.</description>

      <description>I recently discover Aptly which permit to manage local Debian repositories. I waited this kind of tools during several years and now I&amp;rsquo;m really happy.
It is able to manage several repositories, making snapshots, merging snapshots, diff between 2 snapshots, filtering packages to avoid downloading unwanted ones&amp;hellip;.
This is perfect when you want to test before upgrading a critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>One of my ex-boss talked to me about Coursera a year ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a website where you can freely learn several things from high graduated school. Most ofter, it&amp;rsquo;s technology related and I wanted to test it to learn Java.
I subscribed to 2 sessions. One for the java basics and the other one for the object oriented aspect (in french). I&amp;rsquo;ve started it a few weeks ago the first part and what I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very good.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/10/08/galera-innoptimizer-now-support-tables-partition/</guid>
      <description>You may remember the first introduction of that tool here. I&amp;rsquo;ve made changes to support tables&amp;rsquo; partition, to avoid a big lock on huge tables.
The solution is to rebuild every partition one by one instead of rebuilding the whole table. This is smoother and less stressing Galera. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this new version (v0.2).
Note: I still got issues on MariaDB 10 with such thing, I&amp;rsquo;m working on it.</description>

      <description>The first thing you generally want to do when you have any new Storage system like SSD, Disk arrays or a Cluster Ceph, is benching. You will want to know how can read and write throughput. FIO is able to do that for you, here is an example:
[global] ioengine=libaio invalidate=1 ramp_time=5 direct=1 size=5G runtime=300 time_based directory=/home [seq-read] rw=read bs=64K stonewall [rand-read] rw=randread bs=4K stonewall [seq-write] rw=write bs=64K stonewall [rand-write] rw=randwrite bs=4K stonewall You then will have a good output of everything you need to know.</description>

      <description>Cyanogen is finally available on Sumsung Galaxy S5 Europe (klte) :-). Thanks Cyanogen Team! For the moment, you can only grab nighly builds but everything is working fine on it.
Regarding the difference with the Samsung ROM, I noticed the battery life time is a little bit reduced (up to 15% depending on your usage). Camera is working fine, calls, screen etc&amp;hellip; are ok too. I only have minor bugs that I don&amp;rsquo;t really care in fact.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things that may frustrate you with Sphinxdoc and ReadTheDocs. ReadTheDocs has a beautiful theme and you certainly want to use it with Sphinxdoc. However the size of the main text may be too small for you. Or you noticed that when you try to generate a version locally you&amp;rsquo;ll see it works like a charm but when it&amp;rsquo;s compiled on Readthedocs, it will fail.
Here is a solution on how to make it work both locally and on Readthedocs:</description>

      <description>I recently been faced on a classical problem on InnoDB which is the fragmentation, but on Galera. InnoDB engine doesn&amp;rsquo;t defragment on the fly and requires optimize maintenance sometimes to free disk space. But on Galera, which is a fault tolerance and high availability solution, it&amp;rsquo;s a problem having tables locked by an optimize procedure. Until Galera doesn&amp;rsquo;t support TokuDB and only fully support InnoDB, we had (with a colleague (Kevin aka Vinek)) to find a solution.</description>

      <description>Like me you may heard of Netflix for the first time a few months ago because of the announcement in Europe. However it&amp;rsquo;s a massively used solution in the US since several years.
Today Netflix is out and you can freely have a month to discover Netflix. For the moment there are not a lot of films and series, but enough in my opinion to be an interesting solution. Of course because of the French laws, films are more than 3 years old and I hope this will change or I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it will be competitive enough.</description>

What we liked in addition of the hosting, is the usage with GitHub. You can configure a webhook to your GitHub account to automatically ask ReadTheDocs to build a newer version each time a commit is pushed on your GitHub account.</description>

      <description>The day has finally come! After several months of intensive work (weekends and nights), I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that my book on MariaDB High Performance is out!
In that book, I made my best to make things as simple as possible to test features, test solutions and to explain everything in the simplest way. Of course if you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner on MariaDB (and Linux), it may be hard. But if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with basics and want to go further with performances and high availability on MariaDB, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it.</description>

      <description>I already heard of Sphinxdoc a year ago and see some of my colleges are using it for professional or personal usages. With my friend Sebastien Tardif (Teka101), we decided to rebuild a complete documentation for MySecureShell in a more fashion way as the old doculentation starts looking ugly. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s more an oriented Python solution, it can be used for any other kind of project and we decided to use SphinxDoc to make a newer documentation.</description>

      <description>Because of the recent announce from DotDeb about PHP 5.6 availability on Debian, I saw that I totally forgot to move from PHP 5.4 to 5.5.
As I&amp;rsquo;m hosting several WordPress, Mediawiki, Piwik and other PHP web software, I was not very comfortable with that migration. I knew that the major change was on PHP cache. I was intensively using APC cache but in PHP 5.5, it is deprecated and Opcache replace it.</description>

      <description>I recently tested Photo Station on Synology because I was searching a solution to store my photos and accessible through internet with a web interface. I tested Photo Station and was not convinced by the solution as there are several bugs
 Does not retain some default preferences Forget to make some thumbnails when importing a lot of photos in several albums etc&amp;hellip;  I tested AWS backups and even if the price is correct, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow for restoring in my opinion.</description>

      <description>I recently worked on a client issues because of massive SQL injections. As it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easily for the client to fix on the application side and the request was urgent, I dig into writing fail2ban custom rules and it works quite well.
I decided to adapt those rules to block bruteforce login attack for WordPress. The problem is WordPress is not returning 403 error code when a user fail to logon but return a 200 instead :-/.</description>

I made a little documentation on how to setup one, you can find it there.
ElasticSearch is a really powerful solution and I really like working with it. If you&amp;rsquo;re searching a full text search solution, try ElasticSearch, you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!</description>

      <description>I forgot to talk about 1 meetup I&amp;rsquo;ve been regarding Neo4j. A friend (evomusic) talked to me about it and as I&amp;rsquo;m curious, I went to this meetup in July. Neo4j is a highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph database. Neo4j is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading startups, enterprises, and governments around the world.
I you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is a graph database, it&amp;rsquo;s a very good introduction and will help you to understand what it is and how it works.</description>

      <description>I recently wanted to update my Vagrant box running Debian Wheezy. The problem is, the box size is growing on each updates for several reasons. And I prefer to create a new box from scratch on any new Debian release.
Starting from scratch each time is a little bit boring, that&amp;rsquo;s why I created a preseed file (french). That made the install automatically, however I always had to do other step by hands (or need to write a script for it).</description>

      <description>You may know that I really like LXC and the major problem when you want to use that solution in production is: how do you monitor memory and CPU?
Regarding the CPU side, I do not have an easy answer for the moment :-(. However regarding the memory, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Nagios/Naemon check which will check the memory (RAM) and SWAP of a container. Here is how to use it:</description>

      <description>For several years, I was wondering how to make Mediawiki search case insensitive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really had time to look at it until I was really fed up. That&amp;rsquo;s why after a few seconds of search, I&amp;rsquo;ve found an extension for Mediawiki which is working perfectly called TitleKey.
 The TitleKey extension provides a case-insensitive title prefix search. It uses a separate table for the keys, so if it works cleanly it can be deployed without an expensive rebuild of core tables, and dumped when Wikimedia gets a nicer backend through Extension:LuceneSearch (pre 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using for my own servers LXC for about a year now. I&amp;rsquo;m still fed up about bugs introduced by the beta version of LXC (0.8b) present in Debian Wheezy. As now LXC project has released a stable version, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at the Debian backports, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have any chance to find a newer version on it :-(. However, a version 1.0.4 exist on Debian Jessie. I took the Debian sources and recompiled them on Wheezy (available here).</description>

      <description>I am using Nagios for about 8 years now for personal and professional usage. What I can say is, this is a super product, old and stable but not as scalable as I would like. We&amp;rsquo;re in the age of Cloud computing and in my opinion we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to take care about backup and monitoring in now days, this should be automatic.
I was searching a solution for my personal usages, that&amp;rsquo;s why I first wanted a lightweight solution but with enough maturity to auto discover my newly created LXC containers.</description>

      <description>I recently talked about Gogs and really like this solution. The main problem I encounter was the current stable version which may not be usable on Debian.
Here is a quick solution to make it work. First of all, install git:
apt-get install git Then you can download the latest compiled version directly from gobuild.
wget http://gobuild.io/github.com/gogits/gogs/master/linux/amd64 -O output.zip unzip output.zip ./start.sh You can now access to port 3000. If you want to use it through a web server, here is my configuration with Nginx.</description>

 GitHub: can make free public and paid private repositories. Sounds very good, the most powerful solution of the market in my opinion.</description>

      <description>During the last weeks I started to play with Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana. I made a documentation to help on deploying it easily.
As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m an Ansible fan, so I made Ansible playbooks to deploy a complete infrastructure (server and clients). They will deploy this kind of architecture:
On the client side, Fluentd clients will get syslog and Nginx logs, to send them to the Fluentd server. On the server side, a Fluentd receiver will be there to get data from other Fluentd clients.</description>

You can find my Kibana playbook on GitHub.

Sometimes, I want to connect to a home service from the VPN, but my bookmarked links have my home DNS which are unknown from the DNS at work.</description>

      <description>Ubiquiti brings software that are easy to install on Windows and Mac OS. However as it is strongly recommended to let this software always up, it&amp;rsquo;s preferable to have a Linux version to run it in a container or a virtual machine. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to install it for a powerstrip mPower on Debian inside LXC.
The documentation is very poor, that&amp;rsquo;s why I made this one for those who want to do like me.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to test and switch to FreeBSD. Which one I forgot to upgrade since a while and I decided to do it to see if it&amp;rsquo;s the same nightmare I encountered on OpenBSD.
I was surprised by the simplicity of the upgrade and how things happens without any issues.</description>

I really like Seafile even if a search feature is missing :-(. Seafile client is unfortunately not an available solution on all software proposing a cloud connection for sharing files.
Hopefully an alternative exists using Webdav protocol. It is not activated by default on Seafile but can easily be enable. Here is how to do it.</description>

Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager. And hopefully I found very good documentations on Internet (and especially on Arch wiki). I&amp;rsquo;ve made a summary on my wiki if you want to know how to diagnose a Systemd issue.</description>

      <description>I really like this kind of news, new versions of docker and RedHat:
 Docker 1.0: this is the first stable version after more than one year of development. This version is production ready and I will start using it asap. RedHat 7: this is a good news as the version 6 started to be a little bit old now. What&amp;rsquo;s new?  MariaDB replace MySQL \o/ Docker integrated systemd XFS by default Kernel 3.</description>

      <description>I wanted to find a way to properly view resources (memory/CPU/IO) usages or configuration. For that I need to use cgroups. But the problem are on free, top, htop or common any tools, as they do not get the real informations of the container.
We&amp;rsquo;re in fact waiting on a lot of work on the kernel side or systemd side. More information&amp;rsquo;s can be found here. Another solution that permit to bind a socks inside containers exists called CGManager, however classical tools doesn&amp;rsquo;t use it to get informations.</description>

      <description>I recently upgraded the wiki to version 1.23 (new LTS version). As usual Mediawiki made a very good work, no problems during migration using Git, everything is working.
No major visual changes between the previous version 1.22 and this one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t had to touch anything on my JS, CSS or configuration! Great!
I encountered an issue with my GoogleSearch extension and made the changes to make it work again. So a new version (0.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m already using LXC on my home server and see the benefits for 8 months ago. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to migrate this server to LXC as well. The difference here is that I wanted to migrate my VM from KVM. All my KVM VM are on Debian Wheezy so that was pretty easy.</description>

      <description>Luc (@lstep) informed me about an interesting software that looks like Juju at first and I wanted to share it with you. It&amp;rsquo;s called Gaudi.
 If you already use Docker to setup your dev box for large applications, don&amp;rsquo;t you suffer to maintain complex Dockerfiles?
Splitting a service Oriented Architecture into several Docker containers is the solution, except managing links and mounts between them is a pain. gaudi solves that by offering a way to describe a system of Docker containers using a simple DSL.</description>

      <description>This is a very good news if you&amp;rsquo;re using Ceph in production! Originally delivered as a proprietary dashboard included with Inktank Ceph Enterprise, Calamari has some really great visualization stuff for your cluster as well as the long term goal of being the all-in-wonder management system that can configure and analyze a Ceph cluster.
Calamari is composed in 2 elements:
 Backend: the Calamari backend is written in Python 2.6+, using Saltstack, ZeroRPC, gevent, Django, django-rest-framework, graphite, (and a few others I may have forgotten) and instantiates a new REST API for integration with other systems.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt; CoreOS is a new Linux distribution that has been rearchitected to provide features needed to run modern infrastructure stacks. The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience. We&amp;rsquo;ve implemented them correctly so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to endure the slow, learn-as-you-go infrastructure building process. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; CoreOS can run on your existing hardware or on most cloud providers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Docker a year ago, started to play with it for some months and really start using it a few days ago. At first, I thought it was more complex than expected and finally I saw how simple it is and how many time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost because I didn&amp;rsquo;t used it.
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.</description>

      <description>As you may know, related to a previous post, I was using Aviate launcher on Android. I was so happy with it that I started to speak about it around me and promoted it.
My friend Romaric (@evoxmusic) informed me that this software required too much access in his opinion and that I should look at the privacy policy of Aviate.
After starting reading it, I could find this:

 Waterproof: better when you got child&amp;rsquo;s and can record video underwater! Better autonomy: I can have a normal day without charging it! Better camera: once again when you have child&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;The camera makes very good photos compared to Nexus 5. Bigger screen: not a big point for me but it is better Storage: can add a micro SD card.</description>

      <description>Last week, have been faced on a big sniffing issue on my wiki. The guy wanted to download all my wiki content. In reality I do not really care as it is open, free for read and contribution is welcome. However, the current VM where the blog and wiki are running didn&amp;rsquo;t support aggressive sniffing that this guy made. That&amp;rsquo;s why CPUs were at 100% of usage because of PHP requests, PHP-FPM was overloaded (reached my configuration limits).</description>

I started to rewrite my Puppet manifests to Ansible playbooks and what I can say is it&amp;rsquo;s really fast and easy.</description>

First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at this blog post, which kindly resume the current situation. Looking at this and with feedback I got, I could establish this array:
   Logstash  Fluentd   Concerns  Flexibility/Interoperability  Simplicity/Robustness   Language  JRuby  Cruby   Inputs  More  Fewer   Inputs specs  Basics  Scalables   Plugins  Lot  Lot more   Plugins install  Simple (drop a jar)  Can be complex (dependencies)   Logs send crypt  Yes  Yes   Scalability  Forward to 2 hosts  LB A/A or A/P   Reliability  Can loss messages  No message loss    Logstash and Fluentd are both powerful solutions, they both got pros and cons.</description>

Hopefully today, tools that permit to do it very well exists, here are the list of tools that&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to achieve it:

 The mysqlnd library is highly optimized for and tightly integrated into PHP. The MySQL Client Library cannot offer the same optimizations because it is a general-purpose client library.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m running now Seafile since a few days now and it works without any issues. The Linux and Android clients works very well. I just hope a sync feature in the Android version will appear. Regarding the web version, there are all attending collaboration features and that&amp;rsquo;s great. Seafile supports file versioning and trash bin.</description>

      <description>Recently a new person as joined the administration of Dropbox called Condoleezza Rice. The problem is: this person is known to have allowed phone tapping in the US. So should be thrust in Dropbox anymore ?
For me not really. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to look at alternatives. I already tested Owncloud but was plenty of bugs. Also a french post about that situation has been made.
I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at alternatives and Seafile looks like the best alternative to Dropbox and Owncloud.</description>

      <description>The Percona replication manager (PRM) is a framework using the Linux HA resource agent Pacemaker that manages replication and provides automatic failover. This covers the installation of the framework on a set of servers. The PRM framework is made of 4 components: Corosync, Pacemaker, the mysql resource agent and MySQL itself.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to setup, better if you already know how to use Pacemaker and it works like a charm. In fact it setup a master and x slaves.</description>

      <description>monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too much resources. You can use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes.</description>

      <description>You know that I recently switched to i3. One of the first thing I wanted to change is the status bar which is not optimal for my usage.
After researches, it looked like that i3blocks it the best alternative. So I contacted the creator (Vivien) and had very good exchanges with him.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made pull requests and suggestions to integrate missing checks, faster one that I developed and with colorization depending of the contexts.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to install an IRC bouncer as I was fed up to launch every say a ssh to connect to an external server, on which I had a tmux running a weechat to get IRC history. 2 problems here:
 Sometimes, I forgot to connect on it and missed some messages It was not integrated to Pidgin (what I use for any IM protocol)  So I decided to setup a bounce IRC with ZNC!</description>

      <description>I wanted to upgrade my Android version from Cyanogen 10 to 11M5 on my old Samsung Galaxy S2. I though it would be an easy task, but not at all.
First of all, I had to be in recovery mod (bottom button + vol up + power). Then I wanted to create a /sdcard but it didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mount and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to format my sdcard. So I mounted a tmpfs onto it:</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/04/15/naxsi/</guid>
      <description>NAXSI means Nginx Anti Xss &amp;amp; Sql Injection. Technically, it is a third party nginx module, available as a package for many UNIX-like platforms. This module, by default, reads a small subset of simple rules (naxsi_core.rules) containing 99% of known patterns involved in websites vulnerabilities. For example, &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt; &amp;lsquo;, &amp;lsquo;|&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;drop&amp;rsquo; are not supposed to be part of a URI.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I wanted to test NAXSI and it seams working not so bad.</description>

      <description>As you may read, I recently decided to drop Cyanogen :-(. Google Now interface is fine, but not enough user oriented for now days in my opinion. A few months ago, a friend (@sebastien_han) show me Aviate and switched to it. This is an interface that helps you day to day to show you informations and apps you need depending on your localization. I really love it!
Last week I discovered Cover which is a solution for the lockscreen.</description>

      <description>In France, we have the chance to have an ISP/Mobile Telephony provider called Free. They considerably reduced the market price for the Mobile phone communications in 2012. This was very fine for competition and for French people. Now we can have correct prices for Internet and cell phone data. Thanks to Free.
Ceph is quite the same as Free but for storage systems. Since many years, disks array constructors sold us locked solutions with a very high cost of hardware and licenses&amp;rsquo; software.</description>

      <description>Yes once again and for a long time now I think, I moved to i3. It does not make so many thing than Awesome, however working on multiple screen with it, it&amp;rsquo;s better.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to make a new test with it and it&amp;rsquo;s now adopted. I spent a little bit time on reconfiguring all my needs (workspaces depending my screen configuration, opening app on a defined workspace, keyboard bindings etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>This post is to talk about my experiences on Cyanogen. I&amp;rsquo;m using this ROM since a long time now. When I was on my Galaxy S2, it was perfect! I do not remember to have special issues. I was using nightlies and it was stable enough for me.
When I switched to Nexus 4, it was not too bad, but I sometimes had problems on updates that forced me to restore.</description>

      <description>And finally MariaDB 10 is out! I&amp;rsquo;m exited to finish my book about it. Here are the news:
 Replication  MariaDB 10 sets a new standard in performance. It is many times faster than previous generations of MariaDB and especially legacy database MySQL thanks to new features including parallel replication and a further advanced group commit. Also, the replication slaves are now crash-safe. It’s also now possible to replicate data from multiple master servers giving a complete view of the distributed data across big datasets for real-time analytical purposes via the multi-source replication feature.</description>

      <description>Some of you will tell me that most utility is doing it as well. And that&amp;rsquo;s right, but with ccze you will be able to colorize everything with a pipe. For example when you play with a verbose service like Pacemaker, you need to get colorization if you want to win time. Here is an example:

      <description>One of my colleague (Julien Danjou) wrote a book on advanced usage of Python. The book was out today and I strongly recommend buying it. Here is the summary of it:
 Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and more in many different industries. It is fast, flexible, and it comes with batteries included.
Most of the books you read about Python will teach you the language basics – but once you&amp;rsquo;ve learnt them, you’re on your own in designing your application and discovering best practice.</description>

      <description>If you want to easily build a static webpage with parallax effect, you can try the Cool Kitten framework. It is a young project that already have cool stuffs like grids solution, responsive design etc&amp;hellip;It uses Normalize.css, jQuery Easing Plugin and Stellar.js.
You need nodejs to minify CSS but do not need nodejs server to run it, as it is static HTML pages.

So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested by those two configuration tool outsiders, follow the link. Both tools are written in Python, that why it is a Python meetup at first.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to participate to the meetup as this is the first one, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll learn interesting things on it and meet new faces :-)</description>

      <description>Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. You can win a lot of time by testing your application on multiple environments (AWS, OpenStack, VirtualBox, Vmware&amp;hellip;).
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve got a LAMP environment to deploy in production on OpenStack. However, you can&amp;rsquo;t perform your development/integration on it as you don&amp;rsquo;t have access yet. You can&amp;rsquo;t loose time and wait for it to test.</description>

      <description>When you have a huge amount of mail to deliver, you can&amp;rsquo;t release the queue at once and let the server maximize the outgoing mail throughput ! The result will be: you&amp;rsquo;ll get blacklisted from a lot of MX servers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why you should take care of it and do traffic shaping. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little tips on it.</description>

You can find my boxes here. If you want to add one, it&amp;rsquo;s really simple:
vagrant box add deimosfr/debian-wheezy And the second awesome feature is&amp;hellip;the sharing! You can for example have access to a distant and nated Vagrant instance through SSH!</description>

      <description>I recently played with HAProxy and discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a documentation regarding this fantastic software. So if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what HAProxy is, it&amp;rsquo;s a load balancer working on layer 7 and specialized for http protocol.
It is able to handle sticky sessions which is really powerful. More than that, it has a small footprint and can work under a high load traffic.
Here is my documentation.</description>

      <description>One of my colleague (Sebastien Han) started to play (like me) with Ansible. As he is a Ceph master, he often deploy Ceph for tests or production. He generally uses Puppet for that purpose.
But due to some Puppet limitations or big brain fuck it involves, he started to play with Ansible and created a Ceph module for it. He showed me it, when he was writing it and it seamed working like a charm.</description>

      <title>Ansible: the Puppet outsider!</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while now that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Ansible but I only started playing with a week ago. You may certainly know that I&amp;rsquo;m a Puppet lover, but this solution is more powerful than Puppet in my opinion.
So I started to migrate my personal Puppet to Ansible just to play with. Here are the pros:
 No client needed on the clients, only SSH! It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python By default a lot of modules Not only a configuration management tool, it&amp;rsquo;s an orchestrator too!</description>

      <title>r10k: manage your Puppet environments dynamically</title>

      <description>If you already played with Puppet&amp;rsquo;s environments, you certainly know that the major problem is the static form of them. When you want to test something new (a module for example), it&amp;rsquo;s not quite easy without using environments. r10k bring the dynamic feature and easy module managment !
It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to maintain your modules without using a lot of git submodules. Simply declare your modules informations like that:
mod &amp;#39;filemapper&amp;#39;, :git =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;git://github.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered a Vagrant plugin that manage the VirtualBox Guest Additions automatically. I mean, when you launch a virtual machine, it automatically checks if the Guest Additions are installed. If it&amp;rsquo;s not the case or if they are not up to date, installation of the latest version is made automatically !
Here is how to install it.</description>

      <description>Several persons asked me how could they do slides like I did with MySQL/MariaDB for example. I mentioned that I used LaTeX with Beamer and they were all frighten by the technology and language (takes too long time to be able to use it).
I think that&amp;rsquo;s not totally wrong but once you&amp;rsquo;ve understand how it works&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. So for colleagues and friends, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation on how to use beamer and provided a template to get a quick start on it.</description>

      <description>Big resolution with small screens is more and more common and we&amp;rsquo;re facing a problem on fonts visualization as the readability is not optimal. We have a lot of non adapted fonts for retina display, even if most of them are not so bad. The solution to resolve that problem is to install additional fonts to replace the default one. And one of the best one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is Infinality fonts !</description>

      <description>Yesterday a colleague (Dimitri) tested a tool on this blog. He informed me that Varnish was disabled and PageSpeed may be the cause as this is the last modification I&amp;rsquo;ve made on the server.
After verification he was totally right ! By default, PageSpeed disable cache by serving HTML files with:
Cache-Control: no-cache, max-age=0 After reading the PageSpeed documentation on that topic, it is clear: PageSpeed needs to know how to purge the cache as it rewrites a lot of elements and it has the control instead of the application.</description>

      <description>Following a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled PageSpeed on both wiki and blog deimos.fr.
What I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to take the time to test every optimizations you want to add. I experienced for example issues on silly things like :
# Optimize browser rendering pagespeed EnableFilters lazyload_images; Some images weren&amp;rsquo;t shown if you didn&amp;rsquo;t refresh once again your page browser. I only had this problem on the blog and not the wiki.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve first heard of Page Speed last year for Apache. I was really waiting a stable version for Nginx and it&amp;rsquo;s now done. A few days ago, Nicolargo made a post regarding it and that&amp;rsquo;s what motivated me to go ahead on Page Speed.
PageSpeed speeds up your site and reduces page load time. This open-source webserver module automatically applies web performance best practices to pages and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow.</description>

Getting started with MySQL Performance Schema
First of all, I started with a MySQL Performance Schema presentation :
http://dimitrik.free.fr/mysqltechday_2013_10/MySQL_PFS_2013-dim.pdf
I saw that I had underestimated the power of Performance schema ! We can for example see iowaits and waiting time on tables files.</description>

For those who never heard of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a kernel built in replacement of iptables. All features are not there yet but should be implemented in 3.15.

      <description>Varnish is a real powerful cache solution for web servers. He is unfortunately not able to do it over SSL. Anyway, there is a solution by offloading it with Nginx. Here is a schema to get a better understanding :
Nginx decrypt SSL, pass it in clear to Varnish. If Varnish got it, replies to Nginx which crypt back data to send to user.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a full documentation to get it working well, follow the link.</description>

      <description>In addition of object storage, Ceph is able to provide block devices. Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.
For example this is used to store Virtual Machines on OpenStack. With that solution, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a real fault tolerance system for your VM and distributed.
The RBD part is an easy task when you&amp;rsquo;ve already setup a Ceph cluster.</description>

      <description>Following the previous post, on Ceph Storage, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation with informations to play with OSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered :
 Setup OSD Remove OSD Use Ceph Ojects Storage  Using the object storage system is not complicated and easily scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s a real pleasure to work with that kind of solutions. If you&amp;rsquo;re already working with other objects storage solutions, you won&amp;rsquo;t be lost.</description>

      <description>I finally started to play with Ceph to add it in production. I&amp;rsquo;m still impressed by this storage solution. Just to remind, Ceph is an open-source, massively scalable, software-defined storage system which provides object, block and file system storage (not yet ready for production usage) in a single platform. It runs on commodity hardware-saving you costs, giving you flexibility. And as it’s in the Linux kernel, it’s easy to consume.</description>

      <description>Cgroups permit to restrict a process to specific hardware like CPU or limiting IO disk etc&amp;hellip; Managing it manually could be a nightmare and hopefully, a good workaround exists.
It&amp;rsquo;s called cgconfig and allows you to have a running daemon to apply restrictions on all new running process. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation for it and spent time on it as it&amp;rsquo;s not properly Debian packaged yet :-(</description>

It wasn&amp;rsquo;t charging the proper the drivers in the correct order. That&amp;rsquo;s why MID card was used before PCH. So I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to listen anything and that&amp;rsquo;s why Youtube videos didn&amp;rsquo;t worked.</description>

      <description>Piwik 2.0 has been released a few days ago. The upgrade of my version was done without any issues (as a rule with Piwik).
I like the look of this new version and like the new mobile application on Android. It&amp;rsquo;s really better organized and really looks like as an application (compared with the first version).
There are some new interesting features for professionals (not for my personal usage).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good alternative to Google Analytics and you should try it.</description>

      <description>On android, you may need some folder to no being indexed. It could be photos or videos&amp;hellip;
To do so, use a ES Explorer for example and a &amp;lsquo;.nomedia&amp;rsquo; file inside the desired folder.
No index will be done in that folder. I like to do it when I temporary add TV series and don&amp;rsquo;t want them to be indexed. By this way I don&amp;rsquo;t see them in the Gallery application for example.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to set a website in maintenance and wanted to do it as quickly as possible with any restart of Nginx.
The idea is to add a maintenance.html page at the root of your web folder and then the maintenance page is automatically taken into account.
To do it, simply follow the link (in french).</description>

      <description>In those time, security is more and more important. Some vulnerabilities have been discovered and security on your SSL should be added. In fact you need to restrict the possibilities to your SSL server to avoid SSL breaks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation to add SSL Resumption and authorized ciphers algorithms.
Then you can check your SSL server security here : https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html.
I hope this will help you.</description>

      <description>Once again, I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded my wiki (wiki.deimos.fr) and it was really easy with git.
We could see some new minor design changes like &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; banners or the login page. Other interesting features are appearing like load time informations for each page edition or embedding Vector theme in the Core. A new extension manager is used called Composer and will try to look at it&amp;rsquo;s benefits shortly.
Once again, thanks Mediawiki !</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/11/28/lxc-use-dnsmasq-instead-of-libvirt/</guid>
      <description>LXC is a really good container solution to replace older container solutions like OpenVZ or Vserver for instance. Libvirt is a wonderful tool to manage different hypervisors and containers solutions. Anyway Libvirt is unfortunately not able to fully manage LXC (create, delete&amp;hellip;) today.
That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to get it running and installed on a server, but it could be useful if you have KVM and LXC working on the same machine to get the same tool to handle start/stop containers/VMs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy to receive the new Nexus 5 today. I love the Nexus 4 but&amp;hellip;do not have enough space on it, even with the 16G version.
So I have bought the 32G and will be happy to get the photo stabilizer. Those are the major enhancement that makes me take the new Nexus.
I&amp;rsquo;m waiting the Cyanogen ROM to get all advanced features I like and hope it will be available soon.</description>

      <description>So this is my first update to get a full working MacBook Pro under Debian. For now, as already talked in a last post, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make every things working.
The remaining nonworking things/problems were and the resolutions I&amp;rsquo;ve found :
 The iSight Camera : still not working (didn&amp;rsquo;t had time to search solution neither) The Speaker : should work with the latest kernel and patch (RedHat bugzilla) but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to test it yet (3.</description>

      <description>The lego calendar is a wall mounted time planner that we invented for our studio. It’s made entirely of lego, but if you take a photo of it with a smartphone all of the events and timings will be magically synchronised to an online, digital calendar. It makes the most of the tangibility of physical objects, and the ubiquity of digital platforms, and it’s also puts a smile on our faces when we use it!</description>

      <description>Redshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in front of the screen at night.
Two of my colleagues (Julien and Axel) praise virtues of this application. So I started to use it yesterday. For the moment, my opinion is good during the night, but during the day&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t have opinion for the moment.
Here is my configuration.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve reinstalled my desktop on my new MacBook Pro 13, I had to fight with some problems with my Yubikey. I never had such and wonder if it couldn&amp;rsquo;t comes from a Debian package update.
Anyway, I had problem with permissions on the USB device and found a udev solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation and let you check and would like a feedback if some of you have encountered the same issue (USB error: Access denied (insufficient permissions))</description>

      <description>Galera uses a preallocated file with a specific size called gcache, used to store the writesets in circular buffer style. By default, its size is 128MB and it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to upgrade it to a higher value.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation on that if you want to check. In addition, you can find more informations, I suggest a Severalnines link.</description>

      <description>This is not a really good news. An announcement at OSMC (Open Source Monitoring Conference) as been made by Andreas Ericsson ( Nagios 4 core dev) about the future of Nagios.
Nagios 4 is the latest Core version of the project ! Only the enterprise version will remain (strategic choice of Ethan, the creator).
A Nagios 4 fork will appear called Naemon and developed by Andreas Ericsson. I remind as well that the Shinken is a real good alternative and is able to work with your current Nagios configuration.</description>

      <description>I recently crypted all my disk as I changed laptop. At the beginning, I just tested a simple password to see performances changes.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t really see changes for the moment.
Once I&amp;rsquo;ve finished to install and configure my needs, I wanted to have a strong password solution. I decided to use a remembered password concatenated to a generated yubikey password.
I updated my LUKS tutorial to explain how to update the password.</description>

      <description>I tested to install Debian as I love it more than Mac OS X for work on my new MacBook Pro 13 retina. Most of the hardware works out of the box on a Debian Jessie (because of the kernel version &amp;gt; 3.8) but is not really optimal. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I did to make it better.
First of all, you need an EFI manager. I discovered that Refit is not maintained anymore and let place to rEFInd instead.</description>

      <description>Yes I did it ! I finally switched from my fantastic Lenovo to the latest MacBook Pro 13.
Some of you won&amp;rsquo;t understand why I did it, but in fact you&amp;rsquo;ll see this is an evidence. What was the problem with the Lenovo ? Just the weight ! I&amp;rsquo;m usually transporting it from work to home and vice versa. I now have a backache and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue like that. Hopefully eNovance is a comprehensive company and allowed me to switch to another laptop of my choice.</description>

      <description>I finally found a tiling window manager for OS X and it&amp;rsquo;s free ! It&amp;rsquo;s called Xnomad and could be found on GiHub.
Easy to install, it gives the major features of a standard tiling window manager. This is a must have for me now on OS X.
Hope you&amp;rsquo;ll like it as I !</description>

      <description>Once again Mozilla made a future hit ! TogetherJS is a service you add to an existing website to add real-time collaboration features. Using the tool two or more visitors on a website or web application can see each other’s mouse/cursor position, clicks, track each other’s browsing, edit forms together, watch videos together, and chat via audio and WebRTC.
Plugins already exist for WordPress and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate in any website :-).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to see my readers there and more than that if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t met this year. So save the date :-)</description>

      <description>Hi all,
This time, I&amp;rsquo;m asking help to find a good load testing tool. The one I know is Tsung but it&amp;rsquo;s not able to speak to some social API. I would like to know what kind of solution you are using and your feedback on it. I already played with Jmeter and I do not remind that it&amp;rsquo;s able to do better.
Any help is appreciated :-)

      <description>A little bit fed up about changing window manager to find the best one for my needs, after i3, I&amp;rsquo;m testing DWM.
I3 was really nice, but got too much limitation from my point of view. The configuration is too static while Awesome really flexible so the change was hard. An old colleague reminds me about DWM and gave me a real good feedback on it as he&amp;rsquo;s using it daily since a long time now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Awesome WM for a few months and really like it&amp;rsquo;s modular LUA configuration file. But I encounter some little problems with window resizing that waste my time day to day and forced me to look at an alternative.
A colleague who encountered the same issue talked to Awesome creator (Julien Danjou) that I sometimes have the chance to see at eNovance. It looks like a complicated bug to resolve, he&amp;rsquo;s not the core maintainer anymore and as it will take too much time to resolve it, this bug shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fixed one day.</description>

      <description>Ceph is a high availability way to store your data. I really love that solution and how it works. It&amp;rsquo;s a real good alternative to high cost disks storage. With some colleges of eNovance, we&amp;rsquo;re currently participating to the Ceph Day today in London (http://www.inktank.com/CEPHdays/).
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be here, as I wanted to put in production Ceph, 4-5 years ago (when it was released as experimental in Linux Kernel).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been interested in NAS solutions as I&amp;rsquo;ve always made my own server and installed what I needed manually. In addition I always thought that it was closed sources since a friend show me I was wrong.
He definitively convinced me and I bought a Synology DS713+ last week. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to use, brings a lot of features and the biggest point : it&amp;rsquo;s an open system. I mean that you can have root access on a busy box and do what you want.</description>

      <description>Speaker Deck is the best way to share presentations online. Simply upload your slides as a PDF, and they will turn them into a beautiful online experience. View them on SpeakerDeck.com, or share them on any website with an embed code. More than that, it produces HTML 5 slides and there are no Ads :-)
I&amp;rsquo;m fed up about slideshare which doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow as it should be. They still produce flash slides and as many people, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it anymore.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a Windows binary that you can find on my GitHub or on my Git.
I did it in Perl. As described in the last post as I needed to have the interpreter embedded in the binary. I&amp;rsquo;m so bad to find good application name that I called it url_service_action.</description>

This time, I tried to reproduce the tips but encountered several issues. The first one was that error :
The locale codeset (cp1252) isn&amp;#39;t one that perl can decode, stopped at Encode/Locale.pm line 94. It could simply be resolved by addressing &amp;lsquo;-x&amp;rsquo; parameter to the &amp;lsquo;pp&amp;rsquo; command line.</description>

I needed to quit Free for Orange provider as it wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible to get Free for FTTH for the moment.
The Orange box is really not as good as the Free one and the booting time is around 5 min !
I can easily say they wanted to be in the competition with Free, but without blue ray and with only basics options is the box, they are totally out of the run.</description>

      <title>Shell : back to directory command (bd)</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/09/19/shell-back-to-directory-command-bd/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/09/19/shell-back-to-directory-command-bd/</guid>
      <description>I recently read a post (on Korben&amp;rsquo;s blog) regarding a command called bd to go back to a directory from you current full path. It permits to do more than that !
In fact this is a simple shell script, but it really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re in a long subfolder list. For example if you reside in &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever&amp;rsquo; and want to change to &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/test&amp;rsquo;, then try &amp;lsquo;bd p`/test.
If you want to see all the possibilities, you can look at the main site project.</description>

      <description>As said in a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get Internet through FTTH (Fiber To The Home). Unfortunately I won&amp;rsquo;t get a fixed IP like I currently have with my ADSL provider.
It reminds me Internet 10 years before, when I needed to play with dyndns or no-ip to be able to connect to my house ISP. The story is now repeating but as I got real DNS instead, I need to send the modifications to my DNS Registrar instead.</description>

      <description>As you can see, I write more and more posts on LXC. The latest thing I worked on, was how to convert a host/vm to a LXC container. I needed to write a script for it as I didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I needed.
The script will remove unneeded elements in a Debian system, removing folders (dev,proc,sys), recreate devices and configure etc files. You can find more informations by following the link.</description>

I unfortunately have to leave Free for this year and hope I&amp;rsquo;ll could switch back to it in a year.
The bad news is I&amp;rsquo;ll have a random public IP :-(.</description>

      <description>What a topic ! It could sounds like a patent troll but let me explain why I posted it.
First of all, I do not have strong skills on Arch Linux, but so many people talked to me about it and have praised me the merit of that distribution that I absolutely needed to test it. Before, I was on Debian testing and had some setbacks that encouraged me to look ahead to find a better solution.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve write with emacs/vim or any other classical tool editor, a manifest or a Puppet module. If you did it, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of syntax errors or got errors during catalog compilation. During a long time, I was using Geppetto to help me on writing and suggesting better syntax to my manifest.
I took the latest available version of Geppetto but it crashes all the time.</description>

      <description>Awesome is still my window manager and I still love it. With my laptop, I need to be able to quickly get my working environment when I power it on. The major problem I had was to avoid having the same opened windows at boot if I&amp;rsquo;m in the train, at work or at home. Of course there is no GPS in the laptop to detect my location, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set a rule for it.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing a Puppet module for MySecureShell. And the thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to quickly find the relevant information on how to build a module from scratch. I like to have experience return and what a chance when I saw a tweet regarding it, the same day as I started to write the module :-)</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m new to LXC, I am discovering how it works, see the maturity of the project and it&amp;rsquo;s integration in Debian. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a post a few weeks ago to introduce the basics and now I&amp;rsquo;m digging in advanced features.
I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered several issues. Most of them are not critical but unfortunately looks like a lack of integration on Debian.
 The first one is related to wheezy template and I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it in a previous post.</description>

I like this repository as it&amp;rsquo;s updated faster than the Debian one and you can have the latest version of some packages. Of course you can do package pinning if you only want one or a set of packages.

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/08/22/glances-all-in-one-monitoring-shell-tool/</guid>
      <description>Glances is a cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool written in Python.
It avoids to run several tools to get a all in one overview of your system. For example, when you want to quickly see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong on a system for diagnosis, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to launch top/htop, iostat, vmstat&amp;hellip;Glances gives you a large overview of your system health.
You can then investigate with the appropriate tool if you want. But you didn&amp;rsquo;t waste your time in opening several tools to get the first desired information : where does the problem comes from ?</description>

      <description>The goal of this documentation is how to quickly setup a monitoring screen machine for Nagios/Shinken. Several times in several company I had to do that kind of thing. On Mac OS and Linux.
I finished to create a documentation for the next times I&amp;rsquo;ll have to deploy such things. The idea is to have a machine that nobody never touch once installed. It&amp;rsquo;s always boring to plug a keyboard and a mouse when somethings goes wrong on this kind of machine that you normally never have to touch.</description>

As for LaTeX&amp;rsquo;s newbies it&amp;rsquo;s not really easy to start Beamer and as many people liked my last slides on MariaDB/MySQL. More than that, I had to make a presentation on DRBD at work and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write it with Beamer.

I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to setup Apache Lucene or Apache Solar as both are in Java. I always heard good feedback about Sphinx, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to add it at work and to my wiki as well.</description>

This feature is embedding videos without requesting additional extension and specific tags, it&amp;rsquo;s a built-in HTML5 media player. It was already possible to add videos but they weren&amp;rsquo;t playable directly on the page, it was a link.
As I manage the blog of my daughter, this is a really good news.</description>

How does PackStack works ? Some of you may tell me that DevStack do the same thing. But I warn once again about DevStack which is absolutely not build for production usages ! PackStack is a bundle of current modules for OpenStack available on Puppet Forge.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a fast solution build on top of VirtualBox. I already talked about it in a previous post.
The thing is, you could do really more with Vagrant by adding Puppet manifests or Chef recipes in your Vagrant configuration file. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t often use one of those 2 softwares, it quickly could transform into a nightmare when they want to deploy softwares in addition of the OS.</description>

In addition, sometimes I need to set up a quick desktop environment with my preferences and deploy all I need may take a while. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve written some scripts (in Python and shell script) to help on deploying all my configuration and all the packages I wish.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone ! As you know I recently started to play with LXC :-)
At the beginning of my tests, I unfortunately found an annoying bug which avoid performing correct Debian installation over LVM.
I tried to resolve it by myself but didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to finish my investigation. After quick searches, I found that other people found the bug on github : https://github.com/simonvanderveldt/lxc-debian-wheezy-template/issues/1#issuecomment-21303483
As a rule, I searched it on Debian bugs list but nothing was reported.</description>

I bought HJC Ben Spies replica because vendor convinced me that HJC was a really good outsider. The first 2 months, I was happy of my new helmet. Then I got problem with the helmet strap which broke and the visor&amp;rsquo;s rubber (rain bypassed it).</description>

I hope this will help some of you if problems occurs.</description>

In addition, there were some informations related to Galera Cluster running on top of MariaDB. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation to help on choosing the better SST method and understand the differences (in french).</description>

      <description>Git : have you ever tried to play with it ? For several years I&amp;rsquo;m working with that fantastic tool. Anyway the biggest problem is : if you don&amp;rsquo;t work day to day with Git, you need a memento or something similar (like my wiki 😉).
Also, if you use it for your personal usage, you&amp;rsquo;ll be lost when you will work with complex workflows. As I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer, I use Git to manage my etc configuration, my puppet manifests, my custom scripts&amp;hellip;so many basic usage that really help me to win time as a sysadmin.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m a MediaWiki&amp;rsquo;s fan. I manage and use it since 2006 and you can see what I do with on my wiki.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always learned by myself, how to do things on MediaWiki as my needs were classical and for a single user. Some weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a big upgrade for the last company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for (Linagora) and I wanted to implement interesting features for a multi users usage.</description>

      <description>Last week, I started to play with LXC. It is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtual system mechanism sometimes described as “chroot on steroids”.
LXC builds up from chroot to implement complete virtual systems, adding resource management and isolation mechanisms to Linux’s existing process management infrastructure.
I wanted to look at an alternative of OpenVZ and LXC seams to be the better solution. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to play with.</description>

      <description>For more than 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen IBM/Lenovo laptops and I really wanted one to try. Every users I met with this kind of laptop always told me that they are very happy with, are robust and got Linux supported drivers.
As I always wanted to get Mac instead of PC for my personnel usages, I never bought one. And as most of time, enterprises prefer cheap Dell than any other expensive robust laptop, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the chance to have a Lenovo till today.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I wanted to install as fast as possible new VMs headless. In addition, I wanted to give the possibility for my ex colleagues to be able to easily create remote VMs on my desktop as most of them got slow machines. KVM did the job perfectly. I also needed to quickly deploy Debian, so I made a pressed file.
Here at eNovance, I can be selfish :-p as everybody got a fast machine (Thanks eNovance).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought 2 Yubikeys several months ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t really took the time to play with them.
A ex-colleague took that time and configured it on his desktop under ArchLinux. I decided to play with it, see how could it works and with his help, put it in place in a very short time.
I configured it to work in parallel of my password. With that configuration, I do not need anymore typing my password, but only need to plug in my Yubikey.</description>

      <description>Installing old Debian to prepare a migration is quite good when repositories are still available. But for old unmaintained versions of Debian, we need to change some things.
Hopefully Debian still keep all the old versions in an archive repository that is accessible by changing the default url. Even if during install it fails, you can set it up afterward.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little article on it, follow the link.</description>

Fever answered most of them, instead of the mobile client. When I was on iPhone Reeder was nearly perfect, but not really Android with Meltdown.</description>

      <description>I recently talked to a colleague about Vim. As he&amp;rsquo;s a Vim poweruser (VimNinja in my articles comments), he has a lot of interesting tips.
He also talked to me about a super plugins manager that can handle any plugins stored locally, on github or vim scripts. This manager is a vim plugin as well, called Vundle.
I&amp;rsquo;ve adapted my Vim configuration with it. So now on my Git, I simply have my vimrc and the Vundle plugin.</description>

      <description>For several years, I manually managed my MediaWiki instance manually and always upgraded manually, getting diffs, patching files etc&amp;hellip; Now it&amp;rsquo;s over, this method is simply not adapted to my needs.
Now, as MediaWiki use git, I decided to maintain my instance with the git repository and extensions as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a documentation on that :
 Installation method Core + extensions Upgrade core + extensions  &amp;nbsp;
I hope this will help some of you that still manage it by the old way.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve updated them to recover the compatibility on MediaWiki with the latest version. You can find updated version here :

After a few searches, I found pkg2ng :-). That&amp;rsquo;s THE tool for FreeBSD. But unfortunately, as written in the wiki :
 As a consequence of the security incident on 11th November 2012, for the time being pre-compiled packages for pkgng are not available from any official FreeBSD repository.</description>

      <description>Selfoss is a self-hosted RSS reader solution. It could be compared to Tiny Tiny RSS or Feedly.
I liked to test that nice solution. But I&amp;rsquo;m still staying with Fever, as there is no Android version working with Selfoss (only an old one exist, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t work) and the web interface is a little bit slow (compared to Fever). I hope this will be better in a short term as this is the most elegant Open Source version I&amp;rsquo;ve tested for now.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the power of LateX with elegant presentations. The first time I saw it, was at FOSDEM this year (2013) and was surprised by the presentation quality.
Handling is a little bit long at first, but once done, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to think of what your slides should look and only need to concentrate on the content.</description>

Anyway even with new interface and features on iOS 7, there are still remaining work in comparison of Android. And what about new Apple features ?&amp;hellip; Not really relevant one :-(
I&amp;rsquo;ll test it later on my iPad but I&amp;rsquo;m still frustrated even if it&amp;rsquo;s better than the latests keynotes.</description>

First of all, you need advanced features if you are a poweruser. So get root privileges. Then install a mod like CyanogenMod. It will gives you more features to fine tune battery, CPU etc&amp;hellip;</description>

The first time I tried, I was on a 2.x version of Android and a lot of missing features didn&amp;rsquo;t helped me to switch. My cell phone was a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I really can&amp;rsquo;t stand on Samsung Touchwizz layer. That why I decided to install a Mod called Cyanogen (you&amp;rsquo;ve certainly already have heard of this).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m very happy of Mozilla Sync service and trust more in Mozilla foundation than Google for my datas. Anyway there is a thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t like : sharing my passwords into the cloud !
That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to create my own Sync Server. I want to thanks Mozilla for their work, it works like a charm :-). So now I don&amp;rsquo;t use Mozilla server anymore, but my own. Here is the documentation on how I did that.</description>

      <description>I recently talked about my new keyboard and the output sound directly on the keyboard. That&amp;rsquo;s a great thing, but depending on your distribution and the desktop you&amp;rsquo;ve installed, it may not work out of the box.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve written a documentation to make it work.
In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ve modified my awesome configuration to get special music keys to work like a charm :-)</description>

      <description>I recently bought a new keyboard. This is the Enermax Caesar. My boss talked to me about it, as he bought the same.
For several months, I thinked to change my current one, but none really exited me. But this one is really, really cool. The touch feeling is really fine, additional button are nice (more would be great as well&amp;hellip;but it&amp;rsquo;s ok) and the must : input and output sound are directly on the keyboard, without any additional cables (all through USB :-)).</description>

      <description>Like in most of programming languages, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not a compiled one, there is always a solution to make binaries from your sources. To make is quick and easy I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little documentation on it. It&amp;rsquo;s in french sorry, but you should be able to understand even if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak french (or use the translate plugin in the left bar).
Documentation is here.</description>

      <description>Integrit is a simple yet secure alternative to products like tripwire. It has a small memory footprint, uses up-to-date cryptographic algorithms, and has features that make sense (like including the MD5 checksum of newly generated databases in the report.
You may already now the alternatives on OpenBSD or RedHat. So now let&amp;rsquo;s play with Debian :-)</description>

Good written application embed this kind of features, but if it&amp;rsquo;s not the case it&amp;rsquo;s easy to do so with Trickle. See my documentation on Trickle to get more informations.</description>

      <description>When you manage outgoing emails through SMTP, you may sometimes need to test if a service is able to send correctly emails and itself check that there were no issue during sending. You can create a black hole for a specific domain and Postfix will answer from the same manner as if it is ok. It also permit to test Postfix sending capacities on a server.

      <description>In a sad scenario where an application is fully consuming CPU to limit it. To do so, you will need a magic command called Cpulimit that will help you to limit a PID to a desired percentage usage of your CPU.

      <description>Nginx Substitutions Filter is a filter module able to do both regular expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This module is quite different from the Nginx&amp;rsquo;s native Substitution Module. It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just like Apache&amp;rsquo;s mod_substitute.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played with the classic substitution module but due to limitations (only one matching pattern and no regex), it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to do all I wanted to do.</description>

      <description>It´s been a while that I was waiting for a tool that tells me if my Debian server is requesting a reboot or not. Of course GUI tools exists (like Ubuntu update-manager), but on a server machine, where there is no X server installed (thankfuly), this kind of CLI tools can be quickly interesting.
That´s why I wrote a tool called deb_reboot that gives the reboot requierement information in parsing postinstall scripts of installed packages.</description>

      <description>How could this happen ? I found a communication on that and it has simply been removed as there were no updates since a long time. Even if CVE were recently proposed, it&amp;rsquo;s considered as not enough :
http://debian.2.n7.nabble.com/Status-of-haproxy-for-upcoming-wheezy-release-td2907665.html
But guys ! Seriously, do you know how many people are using HAproxy ? It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that it&amp;rsquo;s not in the current stable version of Debian. Now let&amp;rsquo;s check the availability on all Debian versions, it&amp;rsquo;s currently only on oldstable and experimental versions :</description>

      <description>I was searching a way to minify my CSS. For those who don’t know what it is, it’s a method to win space for your CSS as it will remove all unneeded blank spaces and lines return. A lot of websites exists to minify your CSS, but if your website is not online and only running locally, you won’t be able to minimize it.
I found a little software written in Python, that makes it easy, called mincss (thanks to Peter Bengtsson for it).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been running it since a few months on it (on my servers and as a desktop) and I congratulate Debian team for their work ! In the upcoming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll try to start getting involved in some Debian&amp;rsquo;s packaging projects. My problem is : how many time do I have to give ?
One of my first taks, will be to integrate MySecureShell in the officials Debian repositories.</description>

Je vous en avait déjà parlé il y a quelques temps. Allez&amp;hellip;un petit refresh pour ceux qui ont oubliés : c&amp;rsquo;est un fork de MySQL, fait par l&amp;rsquo;auteur de MySQL.
MariaDB prends aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de plus en plus d’essor et nous propose depuis un petit moment maintenant sa solution cluster à base de Galera (qui fonctionne aussi sous MySQL).</description>

Depuis le temps que j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;ancienne et vu qu&amp;rsquo;elle tourne en permanence, je trouve que c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment du bon matos ! Du coup pour remplacer celle ci, je me suis prit la 6501-70 avec Atom 1,6Ghz, 2 Go de RAM et SSD Intel 30G.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques semaines, je discutais avec un collègue de NetBSD. Il me racontait ses bonnes expériences avec cet OS. Vu que ça faisait un moment que je voulais essayé, je me suis lancé et ai changé l&amp;rsquo;OS de ma Soekris de FreeBSD à NetBSD. De plus, iMil n&amp;rsquo;arrête pas d&amp;rsquo;en parler et ça m&amp;rsquo;a donc fortement chatouillé.
L&amp;rsquo;installeur est sympatoche, le coup du pkgin à la fin c&amp;rsquo;est top (bien qu&amp;rsquo;un peu de simplification pour les néophytes serait pas mal) et les VirtIO intégrés, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment bien joué.</description>

      <description>Voici une interface web plutôt bien fichue qui permet de vous gérer vos serveurs Bind. Son nom est NamedManager. Elle sait aussi bien gérer des trucs classique, que des choses un peu plus poussée (la gestion automatique des PTR, le renseignement automatique un subnet, le multi serveurs&amp;hellip;) et en plus elle est élégante !
Je vous ai fait une doc pour sa mise en place qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&amp;rsquo;on pourrait l&amp;rsquo;imaginer.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, c&amp;rsquo;est une très bonne nouvelle qui vient de tomber ! SkySQL rachète MariaDB. Les boites frileuses de passer sous MariaDB, sous prétexte qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas de boites derrière, vont pouvoir être rassurer et y aller pour de la production. C&amp;rsquo;est donc une excellente nouvelle pour MariaDB dont certains moteurs passent en OpenSource comme tokudb par exemple.
Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;à terme, un bon paquet de distributions, tel que Mageia (cc Kharec), vont switcher sur MariaDB et abandonner définitivement MySQL.</description>

Superbe formation, surtout lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on voit ce que LdemonLDAP est capable d&amp;rsquo;apporter en terme de fonctionnalités par rapports à d&amp;rsquo;autres SSO. De plus son architecture et son mode de fonctionnement est très bien pensé.
Bref, un des hits aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui ! Seul petit b mol pour le moment, il n&amp;rsquo;est compatible qu&amp;rsquo;avec Apache. Si vous êtes un aficionados de Lighty ou Nginx, passez votre chemin.</description>

      <description>Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, à Linagora, je travaille dans une équipe de support dont je suis le leader technique. Seulement voilà, mes gars ne connaissent pas de solutions de reporting de machine. Du coup, lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on a un client chez qui on doit récupérer des données d&amp;rsquo;une machine de prod, il est bien pratique d&amp;rsquo;avoir toutes les données d&amp;rsquo;un coup et éviter les aller/retour avec celui ci.
Dans mon ancienne boite, j&amp;rsquo;utilisais pas mal le support RedHat et le sosreport est quelque chose que j&amp;rsquo;ai pas mal utilisé.</description>

      <description>Un peu à la manière de mon Tmux powerlined, j&amp;rsquo;ai fait un zsh powerline. Je suis en train de revoir du coup complètement ma configuration qui est devenu au fil du temps ingérable. Ma configuration n&amp;rsquo;est pas encore finie, mais est pleinement utilisable.
Si vous essayez et avez des suggestions, n&amp;rsquo;hésitez pas, je suis preneur :-). Vous pouvez récupérer ma configuration zsh sur mon git.</description>

      <description>Dans un précédent article, je vous parlait des fonts powerline et de l&amp;rsquo;adaptation de celles ci à tout pleins d&amp;rsquo;outils. J&amp;rsquo;ai pu récupérer d&amp;rsquo;un collègue sa configuration tmux powerline et l&amp;rsquo;ai adaptée à mes besoins. Le résultat ci dessus en screenshot, c&amp;rsquo;est booooooooo :-) !
Vous aurez donc besoin des fonts powerline et de ma configuration tmux que vous pouvez récupérer ici.</description>

      <description>Je vous l&amp;rsquo;avais récemment annoncé, je travaille maintenant avec l&amp;rsquo;environnement Awesome et l&amp;rsquo;ai tuné powerline. Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas encore totalement fini ma configuration comme je le souhaite, mais c&amp;rsquo;est déjà pleinement utilisable pour le quotidien.
Vous pouvez récupérer ma configuration Awesome sur mon git. Dans le rc.lua, vous trouverez les packages à installer sur Debian Wheezy, ainsi que les instructions nécessaire à son installation. Une fois la configuration chargée, faites la touche Super (Windows) + F1 pour obtenir toute l&amp;rsquo;aide nécessaire au fonctionnement de ma configuration.</description>

      <description>Depuis quelques temps, je refais quelques configuration vieillissantes pour les mettre au goût du jour. Entre autre, j&amp;rsquo;ai découvert par un collègue, les polices Powerline. Et j&amp;rsquo;ai kiffé. Comme le montre le screeshot ci dessus, ça nous fait des espèces de flèches jolies. Si je ne dis pas de bêtises, l&amp;rsquo;origine de ceci est un module pour Vim et aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui on commence à voir apparaître plusieurs outils utilisant ces powerlines. Je vous présenterais les miens dans les prochains jours.</description>

      <description>Cela fait un moment que je me pose la question de mettre le blog et mes articles du wiki en anglais. Cela permettrait de toucher un peu plus de monde, mais aussi d&amp;rsquo;en écarter malheureusement certains :-(
Je vous rassure, je ne vais pas faire une conversion de ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, mais je souhaiterais écrire les prochains articles blog et wiki en anglais. Faire les 2 en parallèle ne serait pas faisable compte tenu du temps que cela me prendrait.</description>

      <description>Ahhhhh, je crois que je vais enfin pouvoir me poser un moment ! J&amp;rsquo;ai enfin trouvé mon environnement de bureau pour être productif, ça s&amp;rsquo;appelle Awesome et comme son nom l&amp;rsquo;indique ça l&amp;rsquo;est ! Je tourne donc depuis 2 mois maintenant sous Awesome et suis ravis du résultat. C&amp;rsquo;est stable, très léger, embarque plusieurs mode de tilling est prévu pour le mouseless et dépourvu de toutes fioritures inutiles comme on peut trouver sous Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment aidé un ancien collègue qui avait besoin d&amp;rsquo;une solution pour forcer des utilisateurs ayant déjà un shell LDAP à avoir un shell plus restreint de type lshell. La problématique est que si l&amp;rsquo;on change le shell au niveau LDAP, il faudra alors utiliser ce shell sur toutes les machines. Ce n&amp;rsquo;est donc tout simplement pas envisageable.
Par contre, il est possible de modifier les propriétés NSS lors du login :-).</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai en ce moment besoin d&amp;rsquo;installer beaucoup de machines, donc j&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour le preseed que j&amp;rsquo;avais pour Squeeze et ai complété un peu plus ma documentation. Rien de bien sorcier, c&amp;rsquo;est juste ultra pratique de rien avoir à rentrer pour l&amp;rsquo;installation d&amp;rsquo;une machine et laisser la gestion du reste à Puppet par exemple.
Pour ceux qui veulent voir à quoi ça ressemble&amp;hellip;ça se passe ici.
J&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour le mettre également sur mon git.</description>

      <description>Si vous voulez tester OpenStack sans vous fatiguer, il existe un projet baptisé DevStack. C&amp;rsquo;est un simple script shell qui va vous construire une machine avec tous les composants nécessaire pour pouvoir tester et développer sur un environnement OpenStack.
Et ce qui est bien, c&amp;rsquo;est de pouvoir faire du Qemu dans du KVM. Bon attention aux performances et aux bugs quand même, je vous rappelle que c&amp;rsquo;est du test et que ça s&amp;rsquo;appuie sur la version actuelle du repository.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques années, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà fait un upgrade de mon Mac Mini qui me sert aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de serveur.
Maintenant, je commence a avoir de nouveaux besoins, nécessitant de plus en plus de ressources. J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà quelques problèmes d&amp;rsquo;I/O, ce qui m&amp;rsquo;a pousser à prendre un SSD et un besoin de plus des 4 Gb de mémoire installés. En parcourant la documentation de mon Mac mini, la taille maximale annoncée est de 4Gb.</description>

      <description>Et voilà encore une migration de faite. Elle s&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien passée, alors que c&amp;rsquo;était mal partie. En effet, il a fallut que je change la configuration de mon Nginx pour que cette nouvelle mouture fonctionne. Ces informations n&amp;rsquo;étant pas marquées dans la documentation officielle, j&amp;rsquo;ai perdu un peu de temps en pensant que ma migration avait foirée.
En montant une autre plateforme from scratch, j&amp;rsquo;avais le même problème. Le soucis était alors rapidement identifiable.</description>

MediaWiki est un logiciel libre orienté serveur, disponible sous Licence publique générale GNU (GNU General Public License – GPL). Il est conçu pour fonctionner dans une ferme composée d’un bon nombre de serveurs appartenant à un site web qui peut avoir plusieurs millions de clics par jour. MediaWiki est un logiciel extrêmement puissant, adaptable à souhait et permettant une implémentation de wiki aux fonctionnalités riches.</description>

Dans le même esprit (mais plus orienté développement), on a l&amp;rsquo;ancien et vénérable Bugzilla qui fonctionne parfaitement et est utilisé encore aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui par de nombreuses sociétés ou pour des projets communautaires.
Je vous ai fait une petite documentation sur la mise en place de Bugzilla car j&amp;rsquo;ai du en installer une récemment. Si vous avez envie de jouer un peu avec, c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;occasion :-)</description>

      <description>KVM, quel merveilleux hyperviseur ! Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise depuis plusieurs années sur mes serveurs et je commence a l&amp;rsquo;utiliser sur ma workstation pour plusieurs raisons. Je vais comparer KVM a l&amp;rsquo;outil de virtualisation gratuit, a la mode : VirtualBox. Voici les raisons qui me poussent a passer a KVM :
 La licence : VirtualBox c&amp;rsquo;est bien, mais si je peux éviter toute dépendance avec Oracle, c&amp;rsquo;est mieux ! Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas envie de connaître a fond une techno propriétaire qui peut d&amp;rsquo;un jour a l&amp;rsquo;autre basculer de gratuite à payante (faut pas oublier que c&amp;rsquo;est Oracle hein !</description>

      <description>Une fois n&amp;rsquo;est pas coutume, j&amp;rsquo;ai acheté un logiciel. Certains rigoleront parce que c&amp;rsquo;est simplement pour gérer des flux RSS. Mais lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on dépasse les 300 flux utilisés, il est important d&amp;rsquo;avoir un outil performant et fonctionnel.
Il y a quelques jours, Google annonçait la date de fermeture du service Google Reader. Je me suis mis a chercher une alternative self-hosted ! Et a part Tiny-Tiny RSS qui manque de quelques fonctions indispensable, Leed qui ne possède pas d&amp;rsquo;application pour smartphone, le choix commençait a se rétrécir.</description>

Concrètement qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est ? Simplement une suite de CSS/JavaScripts/Images pour habiller ton site et en plus responsiveness. Et a mettre en place, c&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante.

      <description>Les SSD coûtent de moins en moins cher et leurs performances sont incroyables comparées a celles des disques classiques.
Pourtant, si on ne fait pas un peu de tuning pour les optimiser, on perd des performances (moins linéaires) avec le temps et on réduit surtout leurs durée de vie.
Récemment j&amp;rsquo;ai passé tous mes ordinateurs perso sous SSD et par chance au boulot j&amp;rsquo;ai pu être équipé d&amp;rsquo;une bête de course avec SSD également.</description>

      <description>Titre provocateur ? Oui, c&amp;rsquo;est vrai ! En même temps, Vmware se repose un peu sur ses lauriers et OpenStack prend de l’ampleur. Il fallait bien en match pour les départager.
Je suis récemment tombé sur ce match intéressant entre Vmware et OpenStack.
Mon avis personnel sur ce match est qu&amp;rsquo;il est très difficile de vraiment les départager. Tout dépends du besoin et de l&amp;rsquo;évolution de celui ci. Néanmoins, cet article est très intéressant car il cite les fonctionnalités majeures de chacun et les compares.</description>

Il est possible de faire mieux, plus classe et surtout : tout OS confondus (à condition que son navigateur supporte HTML 5 sur), ça s&amp;rsquo;appelle Impress.js !
Comment ? Regardez une démo d&amp;rsquo;Impress.js http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/
C&amp;rsquo;est donc en Javascript, c&amp;rsquo;est beau, simple à utiliser (quand on code un peu). Et pour les moins codeurs d&amp;rsquo;entre nous, voici un autre lien qui devrait vous plaire, c&amp;rsquo;est une interface pour Impress.</description>

      <description>Ça fait des années que je joue avec Git. Pourtant, même en temps que mono utilisateur, je ne me suis pas vraiment penché sur les fonctionnalités avancées de celui ci.
C&amp;rsquo;est lors d&amp;rsquo;une formation accélérée dans ma boîte que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu découvrir a quel point Git est puissant. Pourtant j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression de n&amp;rsquo;en avoir toujours vu qu&amp;rsquo;une infime partie.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis a jour ma documentation sur git avec ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu voir et tester.</description>

      <description>ownCloud est une implémentation open source de services en ligne de stockage et d&amp;rsquo;applications diverses (cloud computing).
Cela faisait un moment que je pensais jouer avec ce produit et c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité enfantine. Il existe pleins de plugins permettant de faire pleins de choses variées. C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment plaisant. Sans parler de la partie cliente lourde bien faite et multi plateformes.
Si vous avez des retours d&amp;rsquo;expériences sur ce produit, je suis preneur.</description>

      <description>J’ai connu ce principe l’année dernière et j’en ai récemment entendu parler de nouveau. J’avais envie de vous faire partager ce principe car j’ai pu le constater plusieurs fois.
Je vous fais pars d&amp;rsquo;une partie de la définition de Wikipédia :
 Le Principe de Peter, également appelé « syndrome de la promotion Focus » de Laurence J. Peter et Raymond Hull, est un principe relatif à l&amp;rsquo;organisation hiérarchique. Il est paru originalement sous le titre The Peter Principle (1969)1.</description>

      <description>Ce type de code bar vous parle ? J&amp;rsquo;ai commencé à m&amp;rsquo;y intéresser il y a quelques temps déjà et ai décidé de creuser un peu la question ces derniers temps. Comme vous l&amp;rsquo;avez certainement constaté, j&amp;rsquo;ai maintenant un QR Code sur mon blog et mon wiki.
Pour ceux qui ne voient pas à quoi ça sert, tout simplement à être scanné via un téléphone portable par exemple pour donner des informations.</description>

      <description>Pour faire suite à mon précédent article sur le Raspberry Pi, j&amp;rsquo;en ai fait une station multimedia en utilisant OpenElec.
OpenElec est une distribution GNU/Linux embarquée ayant pour but de permettre l’utilisation d’un centre multimédia (media center).
Voici un article pour mettre tout ceci en place, c&amp;rsquo;est très facile et fonctionne parfaitement.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai commandé et reçu en moins d&amp;rsquo;une semaine un Raspberry Pi B (512Mb de RAM).
C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment un beau jouet et le rapport qualité prix est vraiment très bon !
Le petit point négatif que j&amp;rsquo;aurais a dire est l&amp;rsquo;absence de bouton power. Du fait que le courant soit délivré par USB, ce matériel fonctionne comme n&amp;rsquo;importe quel périphérique USB, c&amp;rsquo;est a dire allumé lorsqu&amp;rsquo;il est branché et éteint, débranché. Certains diront qu&amp;rsquo;il faut le laisser en permanence branché vu sa faible consommation (~3-3,5W), mais je ne suis pas de cet avis.</description>

      <description>Le titre de l&amp;rsquo;article en dit long. Depuis que je suis passé à Nginx, c&amp;rsquo;est vrai, c&amp;rsquo;est le jour et la nuit comparé à Apache. J&amp;rsquo;en suis extrêmement satisfait ! Cependant, malgré la gestion du cache via Nginx, les performances ne sont pas aussi bonnes qu&amp;rsquo;attendues.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc testé Nginx avec Varnish, histoire de me refaire une opinion et effectivement Varnish fait vraiment la différence, non seulement côté temps de réponse, mais surtout côté CPU !</description>

      <description>Avant d&amp;rsquo;attaquer le 2 ème jour, je vais finir sur le premier (la suite d&amp;rsquo;hier).
Un des supers sujet était Bind 10 que j&amp;rsquo;attendais avec impatience. Il n&amp;rsquo;y a malheureusement eu d&amp;rsquo;informations sur les nouveautés aidant a la HA. Cependant il a été totalement réécrit pour supporter + de 100 cores alors qu&amp;rsquo;aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui au delà de 6, il y a des problèmes de performances. On a également (et étrangement) un serveur DHCP qui est intégré a Bind.</description>

Au menu une petite intro Ubuntu sur Juju et MASS mais piètre qualité du représentant de Canonical. Quelque chose a retenir cependant, il faut vraiment tester Ceph :
Heureusement qu&amp;rsquo;il y a eu une magnifique représentation MediaWiki avec du Jenkins, PhantomJS (incroyable) et d&amp;rsquo;autres produits dont Cucumber (qui est très impressionnant). Le mec de Wikipedia/MediaWiki avait vraiment l&amp;rsquo;air de bien connaître son sujet c&amp;rsquo;était top :</description>

Bref, voici une solution pour supprimer l&amp;rsquo;onglet &amp;ldquo;Discussion&amp;rdquo; de toutes les pages. C&amp;rsquo;est un Hook pour Mediawiki disponible ici.</description>

      <description>Jenkins est un outil open source d&amp;rsquo;intégration continue, fork de l&amp;rsquo;outil Hudson après les différends entre son auteur, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, et Oracle. Écrit en Java, Jenkins fonctionne dans un conteneur de servlets tel qu’Apache Tomcat, ou en mode autonome avec son propre serveur Web embarqué.
Dans le cadre de l&amp;rsquo;amélioration de Limesurvey comme cité dans un précédent ticket, le couplage Selenium/Jenkins est très pratique. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais une documentation sur la mise en place de Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Dans le cadre d&amp;rsquo;amélioration des produits Open Source, je travaille avec un collègue en relation avec le créateur de LimeSurvey pour fournir une plateforme de test de non régression qui sera généreusement prêtée par Linagora.
Dans ce cadre, nous utilisons l&amp;rsquo;outil Selenium pour tester l&amp;rsquo;interface graphique car nous avons régulièrement observé des régressions sur ce produit. Selenium est donc très pratique et surtout d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante !
J&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même fait une documentation sur Selenium pour ceux que ça intéresse.</description>

      <description>Qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est bien Git ! Un peu complexe mais tellement puissant.
Bref comme vous le savez maintenant, la nouvelle version de l&amp;rsquo;extension DeleteHistory est sortie. Et la méthode d&amp;rsquo;installation a la mode de Mediawiki est d&amp;rsquo;utiliser directement git et non plus l&amp;rsquo;outil de téléchargement du site Mediawiki.

Voici la version 0.5 de DeleteHistory avec quelques petites nouveautés lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on demande une optimisation des tables MySQL :
 L&amp;rsquo;ajout du moteur utilisé pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la collation utilisée pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la traduction en Allemand  Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas grand chose, mais ça aide grandement a voir pourquoi certaines tables ne sont pas optimisées.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera ceux qui souhaitent passer la certif. Évidement ces questions ne sont qu&amp;rsquo;une mince partie de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il faut savoir pour cette certif, mais elles permettent toutefois de valider votre niveau et vous entraîner a passer la 101.</description>

Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que les gars de chez Debian estiment que Suhoshin devrait être intégré mainstream dans le code de PHP et que ça ne devrait pas être aux distribution de les packager.</description>

      <description>Pour migrer une VM avec des disques de type qcow2, c&amp;rsquo;est très simple, il suffit de les copier les fichiers tel quel. Mais lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on utilise du LVM, la migration peut sembler forcément un peu plus complexe, bien qu&amp;rsquo;elle ne le soit pas vraiment.

      <description>Fini le duo Apache/Varnish performant mais gourmand en ressources. Pour de gros sites, c&amp;rsquo;est certains que ce couple est très utile, mais pour mon blog, mon wiki et mes autre babioles, pas forcément !
Alors voilà, je suis passé à Nginx et après plusieurs jours dessus, je suis globalement satisfait. Petit bémol pour le stockage des éléments statiques qui n&amp;rsquo;est visiblement pas faisable sans passer par du proxy_pass. J&amp;rsquo;ai pu observer une gestion du cache globale moins efficace avec Nginx qu&amp;rsquo;avec Varnish.</description>

Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas encore, configurer Gmail comme si c&amp;rsquo;était un serveur exchange sur leurs iPhone va bientôt ne plus fonctionner. Le service ferme ses portes pour les comptes gratuits fin janvier.
Google fait ça pour 2 raisons :
 La licence a payer a Microsoft pour utiliser ActiveSync. Parce que Microsoft n&amp;rsquo;a toujours pas ouvert les standards libre sur ces terminaux.  Pour se passer d&amp;rsquo;Exchange sur son iPhone et le configurer pour avoir l&amp;rsquo;équivalence des services, voici comment faire&amp;hellip;</description>

Très pratique lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on rédige des articles avec des ScreenShot !
Bref c&amp;rsquo;est beau, ça marche, c&amp;rsquo;est en HTML5, ça vaut le détour et j&amp;rsquo;en parle ici.</description>

      <description>Mais Deimos&amp;hellip;c&amp;rsquo;est quoi encore cet article ? Pourquoi c&amp;rsquo;est pas technique ?
Ce type d&amp;rsquo;article est ultra important, je vous ai récemment parlé d&amp;rsquo;Infrastructure as Code. Maintenant je vais vous parler de DevOps !
Qu&amp;rsquo;est ce que c&amp;rsquo;est ? DevOps est une méthode qui intègre Infrastructure as Code. L&amp;rsquo;idée ici est de faire communiquer Développeurs et Exploitants de Prod.
A la base ce sont 2 métiers différents qui n&amp;rsquo;ont pas le même objectif.</description>

      <description>Je ne sais pas si vous avez déjà entendu parler de gérer une infrastructure comme un développeur le ferait avec du code. A première vue cela semble étrange, mais après réflexion vous allez voir que c’est très astucieux.
Déjà pour commencer&amp;hellip;qui utilise cette méthode ?
 OpenStack : https://review.openstack.org MediaWiki : https://lwn.net/Articles/480002/  Plutôt des gens qui ont de grosses infrastructures donc. Mais concrètement en quoi ça consiste ? Beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;articles existent en anglais sur le net et abordent le sujet, mais je n&amp;rsquo;en ai pas vraiment trouvé qui parlaient de comment mettre en place ce genre de méthodes et avec quels outils.</description>

Je suis trop trop trop content ! Pas facile de faire switcher des gens sur Mediawiki ou bien de leur faire comprendre qu&amp;rsquo;un wiki c&amp;rsquo;est la vie, même si au début il faut apprendre quelques syntaxe (bien que ce ne soit pas grand chose).</description>

      <description>Newznab est un indexeur de newznab. Il sert par exemple à être utilisé avec SABnzbd ou encore Sick-Beard. Il est ensuite très pratique de pouvoir faire des recherche par celui ci pour connaître par exemple les dernières distributions Linux sur les newsgroup ;-).

      <title>PuppetDB : Augmentez les fonctionnalités de votre Puppet</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2012/12/19/puppetdb-augmentez-les-fonctionnalites-de-votre-puppet/</guid>
      <description>PuppetDB permet de récupérer les données collectées par Puppet comme les facts et d’utiliser entre autres les ressources exportées. Ces données pourront ensuite être utilisées par d’autres programmes, comme le dashboard, ou vos propres outils grâce à une API.
Il est donc utile de mettre en place ce genre de solution quand on commence à avoir un parc d&amp;rsquo;une centaine de machines ou une configuration assez conséquente.
Voici la doc de PuppetDB pour en mettre un rapidement en place.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour la documentation que j&amp;rsquo;avais fait de Puppet 2.7 en version 3.0.
Mis à part les gains de perfs qui ne changent rien a la configuration, j&amp;rsquo;ai rajouté :
 Passenger : qui est l&amp;rsquo;officiel remplaçant du couple Mongrel/Nginx L&amp;rsquo;installation : celle ci se fait très simplement en installant un package deb ou rpm qui va installer le repository ainsi que la clé GPG associée La syntaxe : bien qu&amp;rsquo;elle change un peu, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas eu à retoucher mes modules du fait que je l&amp;rsquo;avais créer avec Gepetto et que ce plugin éclipse m&amp;rsquo;avait aider à écrire correctement tout mon code Puppet Gestion des certificat : puppetca a été mergé dans la commande puppet (comme beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;autres) et s&amp;rsquo;appelle avec les mêmes arguments qu&amp;rsquo;avant via &amp;lsquo;puppet cert&amp;rsquo; Puppetd : celui ci a aussi merger dans puppet et s&amp;rsquo;appelle maintenant via &amp;lsquo;puppet server&amp;rsquo; ou &amp;lsquo;puppet&amp;rsquo; suivant les cas d&amp;rsquo;usage.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment passé mon Mediawiki en 1.20. J&amp;rsquo;ai eu quelques petits soucis avec l&amp;rsquo;URL rewriting et les short URL. En effet, dans cette nouvelle version, ils ont supprimé le $wgUsePathInfo qui a du coup complètement cassé mes redirections.
J&amp;rsquo;ai finalement réussi à retrouver mon URL short mais d&amp;rsquo;une autre manière que je vous partage ici.

      <description>Toujours dans mes articles sur Tomcat, en voici un qui touche au clustering. Que l&amp;rsquo;on soit bien d&amp;rsquo;accord, le clustering Tomcat, c&amp;rsquo;est pas du failover avec un cluster applicatif externe. C&amp;rsquo;est une méthode interne à Tomcat permettant de synchroniser des sessions (et pas que).
Je vous ai fais une petite documentation pour une mise en place éclair de ce genre de solution.</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est un module qui comprends plusieurs sous-modules, tous très facilement activable, d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité déconcertante et pour certains très performants.
Dans l&amp;rsquo;une des dernières updates de Jetpack, il y a l&amp;rsquo;infinite scrolling que je souhaitais activer. Malheureusement, pour le thème que j&amp;rsquo;utilise (Yoko)&amp;hellip;impossible de l&amp;rsquo;activer, il n&amp;rsquo;est pas supporté :-(.

Synergy vous permet de partager facilement votre souris et votre clavier entre plusieurs ordinateurs. Il est libre et Open Source. Il suffit de déplacer la souris d&amp;rsquo;un ordinateur à l&amp;rsquo;autre en passant par leurs bords, comme pour passer d&amp;rsquo;un écran à l&amp;rsquo;autre en multi-écran.

Il existe pour cela 2 manières :

Seul inconvénient temporaire, le matériel est trop récent et certains pilotes ne fonctionnent pas comme le wifi par exemple. En cherchant un peu sur le net, j&amp;rsquo;ai trouvé des solutions pour faire fonctionner les pilotes sur Ubuntu 12.04. Le problème est que lorsque je compilais les drivers sur une 12.10, j&amp;rsquo;avais des kernel panic à répétition.
Sur launchpad, j&amp;rsquo;ai vu que le driver rt3290 était intégré dans le kernel 3.</description>

Pourquoi ce choix ?
 Et bien dans un premier temps, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas envie de perdre de temps sur chaque installe que je fais à devoir spécifier les drivers si ils sont de type non free. Puis le mode user friendly avec les associations sur les fichiers, les logiciels preinstallés à la ubuntu sont quand même vachement pratique, même s&amp;rsquo;il y en a un peu trop à mon goût ou pas les toujours ceux que je souhaiterais par défaut.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment eu besoin de faire des comparaisons de schéma SQL et pouvoir me connecter à des bases de données de type PostgreSQL. Il existe ce merveilleux outil qu&amp;rsquo;un ancien collègue (Merci François S.) m&amp;rsquo;avait parlé qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle SquirrelSQL. Vous connaissez peut être d’ailleurs Squirrelmail :-)
Il permet de se connecter à plusieurs type de bases de données (MySQL, DB2, Oracle&amp;hellip;) et est multi plateformes !!! Il n&amp;rsquo;est certes pas très beau, mais très fonctionnel !</description>

      <description>J’ai récemment été voir le Salon des sports Mécanique à Montoire sur le Loire.
Dans les trucs rigolo, il y avait une simulation de wheeling ! Assez sympas pour ceux qui veulent s&amp;rsquo;y mettre, bien qu&amp;rsquo;en voyant les personnes dessus, j&amp;rsquo;avais une impression de trop facile. Il devait y avoir une belle prépa dans tous les cas. En tous cas l&amp;rsquo;idée est chouette, jugez vous même :
  Et puis il y avait également des buggy avec moteurs d&amp;rsquo;Hornet :</description>

      <description>Pour ceux qui avaient t&amp;rsquo;habitude de travailler sur d&amp;rsquo;anciennes configurations d&amp;rsquo;OpenLDAP (v1/v2), ou comme moi, ne font pas des installations tous les 4 matins, sachez que les fichiers de configurations ont changés et sont super casse pied à configurer maintenant à la main.
J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà observé ceci sur les Red Hat 6.3 et viens de le constater également sur une Debian 6. Donc pour configurer votre OpenLDAP v3, c&amp;rsquo;est devenu un tel casse tête qu&amp;rsquo;il y a des wizard pour l&amp;rsquo;aide à la mise en place&amp;hellip;et heureusement.</description>

      <description>Cela fait fort longtemps que je connais ce soft, je n&amp;rsquo;en avais encore jamais mis en place. C&amp;rsquo;est ultra puissant (voir trop, tellement c&amp;rsquo;est complexe), alors je vous ai concocté une petite documentation pour sa mise en place avec un backend PostgreSQL.

J&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour mettre très légèrement à jour la documentation sur la mise en place d&amp;rsquo;un serveur Kerberos.

      <title>Introduction au NoSQL</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2012/10/24/introduction-au-nosql/</guid>
      <description>NoSQL signifie “Not Only SQL”, littéralement “pas seulement SQL”. Ce terme désigne l’ensemble des bases de données qui s’opposent à la notion relationnelle des SGBDR. La définition, “pas seulement SQL”, apporte un début de réponse à la question “Est ce que le NoSQL va tuer les bases relationnelles?”. En effet, NoSQL ne vient pas remplacer les BD relationnelles mais proposer une alternative ou compléter les fonctionnalités des SGBDR pour donner des solutions plus intéressantes dans certains contextes.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai cherché le moyen le plus simple de faire une faire attendre les gens lors d&amp;rsquo;un submit en PHP/HTML. Je suis tombé sur des trucs en Javascript qui n&amp;rsquo;étaient pas terrible, en Ajax compliqué à mettre en œuvre ou en jQuery avec des kilomètres de lignes. Puis je suis tombé sur cette solution, qui avec un simple div et innerHTML permettait de répondre à mon besoin.
Ok, est moche, mais je n&amp;rsquo;ai besoin d&amp;rsquo;aucune librairie en plus et c&amp;rsquo;est extrêmement simple à mettre en place et peu coûteux en lignes de code.</description>

      <description>Avec l&amp;rsquo;apparition des Notebook et portables de plus en plus petits avec des résolutions assez faible, il peut être vite pénible de faire du Mediawiki sur ce genre de matériels. C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai planché un peu sur le sujet et j&amp;rsquo;ai finalement trouver une solution pour cacher la sidebar lorsqu&amp;rsquo;un utilisateur connecté fait des modifications. On gagne du coup pas mal de place !
J&amp;rsquo;en ai profité également pour ajouter un onglet pour ajouter un fichier plus rapidement lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on a la sidebar cachée.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai fais quelques recherches également sur le net pour voir des benchs entre varnish et le cache nginx. Il apparait qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a qu&amp;rsquo;environ 5% de performances de différence en faveur de Varnish, mais qu&amp;rsquo;il y a une plus grosse utilisation du CPU pour ce dernier.</description>

      <description>La dernière Freebox est pilotable par API. Pour quoi faire me direz vous ? Pour ma part, je l&amp;rsquo;utilise pour déconnecter un disque USB branché sur la Freebox server. En effet, pas moyen de le déconnecter sans se connecter à l&amp;rsquo;interface ou jouer pas mal avec la zapette. Bref, pas cool quant on est pressé.
Du coup, je me suis dis que j&amp;rsquo;allais regarder ce qui se faisait comme API et je suis tombé sur celle ci.</description>

Il existe 2 magasins dans Paris qui sortent du lot sur tout le reste.</description>

Nous l&amp;rsquo;utilisions pour recevoir, avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver au taf ces emails, pour savoir quels sont les problèmes avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver. Cela permet d&amp;rsquo;arriver soit en courant, soit serein :-)
C&amp;rsquo;est un script qui va parser l&amp;rsquo;interface web graphique de Nagios, récupérer le minimum d&amp;rsquo;informations pour un bon affichage sur smartphone et envoyer un mail.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;aurais juste une petite remarque à faire. Le &amp;ldquo;ça sera plus cher&amp;rdquo; peut être remplacé par &amp;ldquo;ça prendra du temps&amp;rdquo;, car dans certains cas le prix est sans importance, seule le temps est important (ça sent la phrase détournée, je vous laisse deviner de quel film ça vient :-))</description>

      <description>Je trouve qu&amp;rsquo;il ne manque pas grand chose à Sabnzbd pour qu&amp;rsquo;il soit parfait. Cependant certaines options manquent et heureusement l&amp;rsquo;API est là pour compenser. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris un script en python permettant de jouer avec l&amp;rsquo;API que délivre Sabnzbd. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai créer dans l&amp;rsquo;idée qu&amp;rsquo;il soit facile de rajouter une fonctionnalité via l&amp;rsquo;API. Ce script permet :
 De voir les éléments que fournit l&amp;rsquo;API XML De supprimer un certain nombre d&amp;rsquo;éléments dans l&amp;rsquo;historique  J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera certains à se plonger dedans, améliorer mon script ou bien utiliser les fonctions déjà existantes.</description>

Après quelques recherches sur le net, j&amp;rsquo;ai fini par tomber sur des posts intéressant pour réparer des videos en MP4. La solution que j&amp;rsquo;ai trouvée fonctionne mais sans le son, qui à l&amp;rsquo;air plus compliqué à récupérer que la vidéo.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai adoré cette boite, il y a vraiment des gens sympas et le boulot est intéressant côté IT. Une nouvelle page se tourne donc, je vous ferais part de la prochaine société dans laquelle je vais rentrer d&amp;rsquo;ici une quinzaine de jours.
En attendant, ce soir c&amp;rsquo;est beuverie pour fêter mon pot de départ chez Youssef :-)</description>

      <description>Paris et sa circulation facile ! La semaine dernière j’ai pu voir que la mairie avait foutu 4 feux en 400m sur les quais ! Du coup ça créer encore plus de bouchons et ça favorise la pollution ! Que d’intelligence ! Tout ça a cause d’un égoïsme dans lequel la ville de Paris souhaite qu’il n’y ai quasiment plus de circulation. Surtout que les quais il n’y a jamais personne hormis l’été lors de Paris plage.</description>

Alors quant il faut prendre une décision pour paramétrer son ampli&amp;hellip;ça coince !

Justement ces nouvelles références qui utilisent l’extension Cite, me permettent de faire quelque chose de propre et qui rendra heureuse les plaignants !</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai fais un article qui parle des bus, caches, elevators et options de queues. Pour le lire, c&amp;rsquo;est comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude sur le wiki.</description>

Sachant que des binaires ont été modifiés, il a dû vérifier l&amp;rsquo;intégralité des systèmes. Pour cela il a fait un petit script, qui permet de vérifier tout ça.

      <description>Je suis un peu sur Gnome shell ces derniers temps et vous le voyez, je découvre un peu. Bref, depuis que Gnome Shell est sorti, il existe un outil qui vous permet de paramétrer tout un tas de choses pour votre Gnome. Un peu à la manière gconf-editor, mais en ligne de commande.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait un petit article avec les paramètres que j&amp;rsquo;utilise : Gnome-shell : utilisation de settings pour configurer votre desktop</description>

Je me suis dis : &amp;ldquo;Bon un Nas, ça serait pas mal quand même, mais ça fait cher pour l&amp;rsquo;utilité que je souhaites !&amp;rdquo;. Surtout que je ne souhaites pas des fonctionnalités de fou, je veux un truc en du RAID 1, qui lit tout les formats video et qui ne consomme pas beaucoup lorsque je n&amp;rsquo;utilise pas !</description>

Vous êtes un sysadmin et souhaitez apprendre à faire des petits programmes pour automatiser vos tâches quotidienne ou tout simplement pour créer des softs. Perl est fait pour vous.
Si vos connaissances en programmation sont en plus limitées, je vous conseil fortement ce livre sur Perl. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai lu il y a des années et c&amp;rsquo;est aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui grâce à lui que j&amp;rsquo;ai de bonnes bases.</description>

 Des pastilles sur les applications pour savoir combien de mails non lu, SMS, etc&amp;hellip; (se corrige avec Go Notifier) La lisibilité des mails est pitoyable sur le client de base et aucun autre ne m&amp;rsquo;a vraiment convaincu.</description>

Mcollective fait la même chose, mais en mieux et propose pleins de fonctionnalités en plus. Bref, il vous permet de contrôler tout un tas de machines très facilement et s&amp;rsquo;intègre très bien à Puppet. C&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;ailleurs aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui ce que j&amp;rsquo;utilise en production. Plutôt qu&amp;rsquo;un long discourt, je vous laisse voir ma doc sur Mcollective.</description>

Vous connaissez certainement Page Speed, l&amp;rsquo;extension pour Firefox qui vous dit ce qui pourrait être améliorer pour optimiser les temps de chargements de votre site. Certains points sont délicats à mettre en place, alors Google a fait un module pour Apache (mod_pagespeed) qui permet de couvrir une partie de ces optimisations. De base, beaucoup de choses sont activées et on voit la différences sur les sites non optimisés.</description>

      <description>TinyProxy est un proxy, tout comme Squid, mais qui se veut être léger. Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise au travail sur ma machine pour mettre toutes mes applications dessus. L&amp;rsquo;avantage est d&amp;rsquo;avoir la configuration du proxy pour wget, apt, etc&amp;hellip; qui pointe en localhost. Ainsi dans la configuration de TinyProxy, il n&amp;rsquo;y a plus qu&amp;rsquo;à configurer le serveur Proxy sur lequel on veut taper pour que toute mes applications soient redirigées dessus sans avoir à les toucher au moindre changement :-)</description>

Bref ce livre s&amp;rsquo;adresse aux personnes ayant déjà fait du Puppet (normal c&amp;rsquo;est un cookbook), qui veulent automatiser au maximum. Voyez ce bouquin comme un retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience avec les best practices à adopter pour faire une bonne conf Puppet.
Pour vous donner un exemple, ce sera aussi mon retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience, j&amp;rsquo;ai utilisé Puppet pendant 2 ans et demie avec les fonctionnalités classiques et légèrement poussées.</description>

      <description>Voici le troisième et dernier article sur Puppet, nous allons parler des modules. C&amp;rsquo;est là dessus qu&amp;rsquo;on passe un temps fou pour arriver à ce que tout soit automatisé. Pour certains d&amp;rsquo;entre eux, je n&amp;rsquo;ai passé que quelques minutes et d&amp;rsquo;autres plusieurs jours. J&amp;rsquo;ai tenté d&amp;rsquo;expliquer chaque module avec les points les plus intéressants, les choses les plus pertinentes pour la compréhension et la découverte de certaines fonctionnalités.
C&amp;rsquo;est avec beaucoup de recul et plusieurs années d&amp;rsquo;expériences dans Puppet que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu arriver à avoir une certaine vision de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il est possible de faire et ai donc passé en revue tous mes modules.</description>

Pour ceux qui se sont arrêter aux manifests et ont trouvé des limitations ou tout simplement ne se sont pas encore posée la question de savoir ce que l&amp;rsquo;on pouvait bien faire de plus que les ressources de base, je vous conseil d&amp;rsquo;aller voir, vous risquez d&amp;rsquo;être surpris par la puissance de Puppet :-)</description>

      <description>Cela fait un moment que j&amp;rsquo;avais entendu parler du module SPDY (prononcez Speedy), module d&amp;rsquo;Apache développé par Google qui va booster votre site web SSL. Plus qu&amp;rsquo;un grand discourt, voici une video de 6 secondes qui en dit long :
  Pour la mise en place, c&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité enfantine ! Comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation pour la mise en place de SPDY</description>

      <description>Un gros travail d&amp;rsquo;optimisation à été effectué et les pages se chargent relativement vite maintenant. On est passé de 18s à 2s dans les meilleurs cas. Je continue encore à essayer de baisser le temps de chargement, mais ça devient difficile. Je pense faire un article sous peu avec tout ce qu&amp;rsquo;il à fallu mettre en œuvre pour arriver à cela. Mais en gros on est passé d&amp;rsquo;un lighttpd à un Apache+Varnish+PHP APC+W3C Total Cache.</description>

      <description>Cela fait quelques jours que je suis EN VACANCES !!!!! Je vous ai tout de même préparé des articles avant mon départ, mais il est possible qu&amp;rsquo;il y ai un creux. Car je ne sais pas si vous avez remarqué, mais depuis le début de l&amp;rsquo;année, il y a un post tous les 2 jours, ce qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas facile à tenir.
Donc je souhaites à tous mes lecteurs de bonnes vacances d&amp;rsquo;été :-)</description>

      <description>Pourquoi tant de haine ? Sérieusement, je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi Solaris et maintenant Red Hat nous poussent à ce que les interfaces réseaux possèdent le nom court du chipset des cartes. C&amp;rsquo;est tellement chiant lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaite gérer un parc informatique de manière automatisée.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais un petit article pour dire comment revenir à nos bonnes vieilles interfaces en ethX. C&amp;rsquo;est pas ici.</description>

      <description>Bon&amp;hellip;on est encore loin du compte par rapport au ZFS hein ! Mais par rapport à l&amp;rsquo;extX, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment un pas de géant. Etant donné que la première version stable du BTRFS est sortie, je me suis dis qu&amp;rsquo;il était temps de faire un article là dessus.
Si vous avez envie de voir ce qu&amp;rsquo;est un filesystem avancé, je vous conseil fortement de commencer à vous y mettre car c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;avenir sous Linux.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;hallucine ! Mozilla arrête le développement de Thunderbird ! C&amp;rsquo;est tout simplement incroyable. J&amp;rsquo;adore ce client et ses plugins en font sa force !
Ils ont visiblement décidé d&amp;rsquo;arrêter car la plus part des gens utilisent le web mail.
Je suis vraiment déçu.
J&amp;rsquo;espère sincèrement qu&amp;rsquo;un fork va voir le jour et que le produit va continuer à vivre.
D&amp;rsquo;après les dernières news que l&amp;rsquo;on peut voir sur le net, il semblerait que Mozilla va se concentrer d&amp;rsquo;avantage sur la stabilité du produit que ses évolutions.</description>

      <description>Vous allez voir dans quelques temps que le blog, ainsi que le wiki vont tracer ! Avec mon pote Evoxmusic, on vient de se prendre une dedibox de la mort. Nous en profitons donc pour utiliser KVM et avons recours à des fonctionnalités un peu plus avancées que start and stop. Par exemple :
 Utilisation des VMs en NAT Une configuration iptables pour passer le NAT Ajouter des disques à chaud Dédier des CPU à une VM  J&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis à jour la documentation sur KVM avec les fonctionnalités citées ci dessus.</description>

Si vous avez déjà quelques notions en Python, ça devrait aller. C&amp;rsquo;est plus un aide mémoire qu&amp;rsquo;un Tutoriel complet pour apprendre Python. Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a suffisament sur le net pour que je tombe dans ce genre de travers.</description>

      <description>PowerAdmin est une interface d&amp;rsquo;administration pour PowerDNS. Elle est faite en PHP et permet de gérer bien plus que la majorité des fonctionnalités de base de PowerDNS.
Elle est très utile si vous avez un backend MySQL qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas très pratique pour ajouter des enregistrements/zones ou toucher à la configuration de PowerDNS.
Pour la mise en place de cette interface, c&amp;rsquo;est par ici.</description>

      <description>PowerDNS est (comme son nom l&amp;rsquo;indique) un serveur DNS. C&amp;rsquo;est un concurrent direct à Bind. Il se veut moins gourmand en RAM et offre une utilisation de configuration plus souple que Bind.

      <description>Derrière ce titre pompeux se cache en fait la méthode pour activer le port série au démarrage d&amp;rsquo;une machine. Cette solution s&amp;rsquo;avère vite pratique lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites accéder à certaines machines qui ne répondent plus, ou bien via des solutions de virtualisation.
C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi je vous ai concocté :
 Une petite doc sur le port série sous Linux Une petite doc sur le port série sous FreeBSD Une mise à jour de la doc de KVM pour pouvoir y accéder cash (oui comme tabata)  &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>L’extension pour modifier les skins MediaWiki</title>

      <description>MediaWiki 1.19 est sorti il y a peu de temps et comme à chaque upgrade, c&amp;rsquo;est un bonheur, sauf lorsque vous faites des modifications de skins ou de code. Pour ma part, j&amp;rsquo;aime bien modifier les skins pour y insérer des Google Ads. Mais voilà, comme je viens de l&amp;rsquo;expliquer, a chaque update j&amp;rsquo;ai tout qui est déglingué.
Donc pour palier à ce problème, il existe une petite extension fort sympathique, qui permet d&amp;rsquo;insérer du code à certains endroits de vos skins MediaWiki.</description>

      <description>Quant on commence à vouloir faire beaucoup de réseaux au niveau de KVM, la configuration devient vite casse tête. C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi je vais en aider certains qui comme moi pensaient qu&amp;rsquo;une configuration VLAN standard suffirait pour faire fonctionner du VLAN bridgé sur KVM.

Alors ceci est fait pour toi !!! J&amp;rsquo;ai concocté un petit script (un peu sale oui je l&amp;rsquo;avoue, mais il a le mérite de bien fonctionner) que j&amp;rsquo;ai pomper sur une discussion Red Hat permettant donc de jouer avec les snapshot pour fsckiser (oui le verbe) à la volée tous les LV de type ext3 et 4 sur une machine !</description>

      <description>Jojo, mon expert MySQL (Joffrey de SkySQL pour ne pas le citer) me bassine depuis un moment à abandonner MySQL pour passer sur MariaDB.
Après quelques benchs qu&amp;rsquo;il a effectué, j&amp;rsquo;ai été bluffé et quant il m&amp;rsquo;a dit qu&amp;rsquo;en 5 min ça s&amp;rsquo;installait&amp;hellip;je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas perdu de temps. Donc le blog et le wiki tournent maintenant sur MariaDB :-)
Je vous conseil fortement de passer dessus, car au final, vous ne serrez pas perdu, vu que ce sont les mêmes commandes que MySQL (normal c&amp;rsquo;est un fork) et vous aurez de biens meilleures performances.</description>

      <description>Pour faire suite à l&amp;rsquo;article précédent, voici une interface évoluée pour Nagios (et Shinken) qui permet de se connecter à plusieurs Nagios en même temps et d&amp;rsquo;afficher des informations plus pertinentes par rapport à l&amp;rsquo;interface standard de Nagios.
J&amp;rsquo;ai également fait de la modification de code pour obtenir une interface minimale afin d&amp;rsquo;être optimisée pour des écrans dédiés au monitoring.

Le petit hic par rapport à URD que j&amp;rsquo;utilise aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui est le manque du multi utilisateur.

      <description>Je m&amp;rsquo;étais fais la main sur la Soekris d&amp;rsquo;un pot il y a un peu plus d&amp;rsquo;un an maintenant et j&amp;rsquo;avais trouvé ça sexy pour l&amp;rsquo;époque. Je trouve que c&amp;rsquo;est aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui vraiment bien abouti et que les fonctionnalités ne manques pas. De plus c&amp;rsquo;est assez scalable, on peut faire a peut prêt tout ce que l&amp;rsquo;on veut dessus, donc j&amp;rsquo;en suis satisfait pour le moment.
Me voilà donc parti sur une de ces distribs clef en main pour ce qui me sert de routeur/firewall chez moi.</description>

      <description>Depuis la version 6 de la Freebox, il y a une interface web (http://mafreebox.freebox.fr) qui permet de controler plusieurs options de celle ci et notamment de la redémarrer.
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une documentation.</description>

 J&amp;rsquo;ai du AirPlay à la maison sans payer une AppleTV, ce qui me permet de balancer le son de mon iPhone directement sur mon ampli via la Freebox. J&amp;rsquo;ai un lecteur Blue-Ray de base sur la Freebox player Je ne suis pas obliger de vendre un de mes organe pour pouvoir me payer un forfait téléphonique J&amp;rsquo;ai une très bonne qualité TV grâce au HD (oui car ma superbe TV Sony Full HD n&amp;rsquo;a pas de Tuner TNT HD (trop intelligent Sony)) Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas besoin d&amp;rsquo;avoir un de mes téléphones DECT branché sur la Freebox Server et donc empêche (dans ma configuration) ma fille de prendre le téléphone et jouer avec Je peux visionner la télé depuis n&amp;rsquo;importe quel ordinateur Je peux Streamer des films sur la télé directement &amp;hellip;  Je regrête que Free ne fasse pas :</description>

      <description>Si toi aussi tu possède une télécommande universelle (Logitech Harmony One pour ma part), que tu veux pouvoir gérer ta Freebox Player comme un périphérique normal (par Infra Rouge) et que tu te demande pourquoi il n&amp;rsquo;existe toujours pas de télécommande abordable qui fasse la techno sans fil qui t&amp;rsquo;embête également avec la Playstation, sache qu&amp;rsquo;il existe un moyen de contourner ceci.
Déjà, il faut savoir que même si t&amp;rsquo;es péter de tune, t&amp;rsquo;as beau t&amp;rsquo;acheter la Logitech la plus cher, elle ne fonctionnera pas avec la Playstation 3 ou bien la Freebox, pourquoi ?</description>

Évidemment, pourquoi les baies de disques FC feraient ça et pas nous ? Allez hop, tous les chemins mènent à Rome non ? Alors c&amp;rsquo;est parti pour une doc sur le multipathing.</description>

Et bien si et on peut en faire des choses dans ce /dev ! Je vous ai donc concocté une petite documentation sur ce merveilleux udev qui vous permettra de lancer des scripts au branchement d&amp;rsquo;un périphérique, de modifier le nom d&amp;rsquo;un device qui apparait dans /dev, de renomer /dev en /mes_periph_de_batard et moulte modifications de la muerta !</description>

Bref, c&amp;rsquo;était à un moment ou j&amp;rsquo;avais changé de pot d&amp;rsquo;échappement et pendant ce changement justement, je m&amp;rsquo;étais amusé à la démarrée sans pot. La qualité de la vidéo est certe très médiocre, mais à l&amp;rsquo;époque&amp;hellip;j&amp;rsquo;avais pas mieux :

      <description>Si vous avez des problèmes de temps d’accès et de débit sur votre espace disque temporaire pour MySQL, alors cet article est fait pour vous.
La solution consiste donc à utiliser le filesystem tmpfs et rediriger ses fichiers temporaires dessus.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc créer et mis à jour mes documentations. Vous aurez donc besoin de :

Quelles que soient les commandes que vous utilisez vous aurez ou non la possibilité de configurer l’utilisation d’un proxy en modifiant un fichier de configuration, une variable de d’environnement etc…
L&amp;rsquo;intérêt de proxychains est que la configuration ne se fait qu&amp;rsquo;une seule fois, dans son propre fichier de configuration.</description>

Il était temps qu’un remplaçant arrive dans mes mains et je ne suis pas déçu car il y a plein de fonctionnalité, une belle stabilité et surtout une plus grande réactivité.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite documentation dessus. Je vous conseil fortement de switcher, Tmux c&amp;rsquo;est géniale !</description>

Heureusement Red Hat à penser aux têtes en l&amp;rsquo;air et a mis dans la commande rpm les options *setperms et *setugids pour réparer les droits sur les packages installés. Bref de quoi réparer votre machine.
Donc si vous aussi vous avez boulétiser, sachez qu&amp;rsquo;une solution existe sur Red Hat.</description>

      <description>Ça y est ! Me voilà chez Free. Pour les proches, amis et collègues, vous devez avoir reçu mon nouveau numéro.
Pour l&amp;rsquo;instant je suis très satisfait de la couverture réseaux ( en même temps c&amp;rsquo;est Orange et je viens de chez Bouygues ).</description>

      <description>Solaris c&amp;rsquo;est bien, sur UFS, c&amp;rsquo;est tout de suite moins bien. J&amp;rsquo;ai eu besoin d&amp;rsquo;ajouter de la swap sur une partition, et quand on fait pas ça tous les 4 matins, se replonger dedans c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment très très chiant.
C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation pour créer du swap sur UFS/ZFS/Fichiers. J&amp;rsquo;en ai du coup profiter pour mettre à jour mes documentations sur :

Strace est utile mais pas user friendly à aborder. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite doc pour mieux comprendre comment il fonctionne et comment l&amp;rsquo;utiliser pour en tirer le meilleur.</description>

      <description>Avec les derniers évènements en Angleterre (loi type LOPSI/HADOPI) qui rend fou de rage Wikipédia, ils ont décidés de couper pendant 24h leur site anglais. Du coup des article fleurissent pour obtenir Wikipédia offline via des outils open source dans un format open source (OpenZim).
Personnellement, je trouve ça sexy, mais c&amp;rsquo;est une usine à gaz aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui pour faire ce genre de chose (à tel point qu&amp;rsquo;ils proposent une VM préconfigurée pour éviter la mise en place manuelle).</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai repassé l&amp;rsquo;examen RHCE et l&amp;rsquo;ai eu cette fois ci. Pour rappel il faut 210 points, j&amp;rsquo;avais fais 208&amp;frasl;300 la dernière fois, et cette fois ci 286&amp;frasl;300.
J&amp;rsquo;aimerais bien dire : &amp;ldquo;En route vers RHCA maintenant !&amp;rdquo;, mais je dois avouer que la route va être longue, cher et parsemée d’embuches. Il va me falloir 5 autres certifs pour atteindre ce titre. Il y en a 2 que je pense avoir sans trop de difficultés (Cluter + Statellite) tandis que la RH442 (celle dont j&amp;rsquo;ai eu la formation cette semaine) me semble bien complexe.</description>

Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, un collègue me dit : &amp;ldquo;Mais pourquoi t’utilise pas Debian en unstable ?&amp;rdquo;. La réponse me semblait évidente, mais j&amp;rsquo;ai demandé pourquoi afin d&amp;rsquo;avoir une autre opinion que la mienne.</description>

Un hommage lui est rendu sur le site de sa société avec un lien vers un livre d&amp;rsquo;or et quelques explications sur son historique sont dispo sur clubic.
Même si je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas très bien connu Paolo, il m&amp;rsquo;a marqué. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré pour la première fois il y a plus de 5 ans, lorsque j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une formation chez Sysdream.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai reçu dans la semaine un mail sur un retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience pour ZFS sur Debian.
Vu que ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas la première fois, j&amp;rsquo;ai décidé de faire un petit article reprenant les échanges de mails que j&amp;rsquo;ai eu avec Mr Thierry Dijoux pour toutes les personnes intéressées.
Thierry Dijoux
 Bonjour,
j&amp;rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécier votre note concernant l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur Debian. Ca marche très bien, et je me demandais si vous aviez assez de recul vis à vis des tests que vous avez fait pour vous demander si l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur une debian en production était envisageable ou pas ?</description>

      <description>Pour régler ces petits tracas, je vous propose donc une petite documentation sur Xtrabackup.
Je travaille actuellement sur un projet à mon taf dont je suis l&amp;rsquo;initiateur mais pas le développeur, qui est FenriSQL. C&amp;rsquo;est un outil qui va permettre d&amp;rsquo;avoir un démon pour gérer tous ses backups MySQL via Xtrabackups.
L&amp;rsquo;outil est en version beta, va s&amp;rsquo;apprêter à passer en rc. Une release du code devrait arriver très prochainement sur sourceforge.</description>

Après quelques petites recherches, voici un moyen simple de créer un &amp;ldquo;.vmdk&amp;rdquo; bindé sur un raw device (la clef usb par exemple).

      <description>C&amp;rsquo;est un truc con, mais par défaut, Squid donne un peu trop d&amp;rsquo;informations lorsque quelqu&amp;rsquo;un le traverse pour accéder à un site.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc modifier la documentation sur Squid pour y ajouter ces 3 petites lignes : # Be more anonymous # That’s three pieces of information you may not want to give away: # - The host name of your proxy server # - The version of Squid it’s running # - The IP address of the system that’s making the request via the proxy forwarded_for off visible_hostname proxy.</description>

      <description>Cette semaine, j’ai eu des GROOOOOOOOSSES merdes avec une baie de disques. Une fois réparée, mon quorum cluster était injoignable, bien que pourtant présent en tant que LUN sur la baie de disques.
Donc quant mes noeuds du serveur se sont mis à booter, l&amp;rsquo;absence de quorum empêchait le cluster de monter et je n&amp;rsquo;avais donc pas la main sur mes machines.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc un cluster de 6 noeuds qui était en amnésie (youpi).</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est très pratique lorsque comme moi, vos noeuds reboot sans cesse pour des partitions flinguées. La documentation est ici.</description>

Donc voilà, je suis passé à Mail depuis 3 semaines&amp;hellip;assez satisfait dans l&amp;rsquo;ensemble, j&amp;rsquo;ai pu y passer sans trop de difficultés, c&amp;rsquo;est plus rapide que Thunderbird à l&amp;rsquo;utilisation mais&amp;hellip;ça plante ! Et les pièces jointes sont très mal gérées.
Donc voilà, Thunderbird is back parce que c&amp;rsquo;est le bien et c&amp;rsquo;est très stable !</description>

Sa contribution à l’informatique moderne a été considérable. Le langage C est un des langages de programmation les plus utilisés dans le monde et se trouve au cœur d’une pléthore de programmes.

Il existe Luks (celui qui a dit skywalker sort) qui est intégré au noyau et qui est bien plus performant. Je pense qu’il est tout aussi fiable (pas testé sur du long terme, mais natif à Red Hat).
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc concocté comme à mon habitude une petite documentation sur Luks.</description>

Mais de plus en plus je lis sur mes flux RSS des personnes qui pleurent d&amp;rsquo;avoir leurs données perdues par Google.

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc choisis de ne pas laisser mes données à Google et de m&amp;rsquo;en occuper. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc choisis Tiny Tiny RSS qui se veut être une très bonne alternative à Google Reader.</description>

Qui lui n&amp;rsquo;était pas encore packagé Lion, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc du recompiler les sources depuis le SVN J&amp;rsquo;ai pu mettre à jour tous mes ports dont Encfs et Macfuse  Seulement voilà, même en mettant tout ce petit monde à jour, impossible de monter mon dossier crypté !</description>

      <description>Je maintiens tout ce que j’ai pu dire sur mes anciens post. Je me rends de plus en plus compte qu’Android c’est top rooté. Quid d’un iOS jailbreaké ?
Je pense au finale que ce doit etre kifkif. Je rappelle encore une fois que les grosses différences entre les 2 sont l&amp;rsquo;ergonomie et les fonctionnalités.
Il ne se passe pas un jour ou je regrette d&amp;rsquo;avoir laissé mon iphone et il ne se passe pas un jour ou je regrette d&amp;rsquo;avoir mon Android.</description>

      <description>Encore une fois, c&amp;rsquo;est une réussite d&amp;rsquo;Apple ! Ce Lion est plutôt bien fait, avec les améliorations à la iOS comme la synchronisation sur un compte Exchange (iCal, Mail et Contacts). Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une révélation non plus, mais on voit à peut prêt ou Apple veut en venir et j&amp;rsquo;espère que ce ne sera pas une régression pour les utilisateurs avertis dans les prochaines mises à jour de l&amp;rsquo;OS.</description>

      <description>Après seulement 7 mois d&amp;rsquo;attente, ça y est j&amp;rsquo;ai la freebox v6 ! C&amp;rsquo;est beau, le packaging bien réussi, plus gros que la v5 (comme chez sony, on va peut etre avoir le droit a une slim qui sait), ça respire la qualité, ça chauffe un peu, la logitech harmony ne fonctionne malheureusement pas encore avec (un petit truc de la part de Free est en cours d&amp;rsquo;après certains forum).</description>

      <description>Round 2, Fight ! Steeves me tannant encore et me montrant les trucs super tip top que Chrome fait…bah j’ai eu envie de renter l’aventure. Et tout comme la première fois… grosse déception !
 Mon blog : Le CSS3 ne s&amp;rsquo;affiche pas correctement WordPress : Créez un article en mode visuel, mettez un lien sur un bout de texte, et tapez sur la touche Entrée pour passer à la ligne&amp;hellip;ça ne fonctionne pas visuellement et pourtant en mode HTML on visualise bien les sauts de ligne L&amp;rsquo;importation depuis Firefox des bookmarks, il a fallu passez par des exports et imports manuel pour éviter le crash de Chrome Firebug moins complet sur Chrome que sur Firefox   Bon, ça commence à faire beaucoup, je n&#39;ai pas envie de perdre trop de temps donc on va garder encore une fois Firefox qui est au dessus de Chrome en terme de stabilité.</description>

      <description>Cette semaine j’ai appris à faire du Python pour voir un peu ce que ça donne comme langage. C’est pas mal du tout, il y a plein de built-in assez sympas. Je n’ai pas encore eu le temps de mettre à jour la doc de mon wiki par rapport à mes acquis, mais j’espère pouvoir le faire très prochainement.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour faire un truc qui sous OpenVZ est super relou : les User Beancounters.</description>

      <description>Quelques jours / semaines après avoir migré d&amp;rsquo;iPhone (5 ans de bons et loyaux services) vers Android, et faisant suite à un ancien post, je vais essayer de faire un petit article plus constructif.
Pour rentrer dans le vif du sujet, ceux qui attendent la réponse à : Est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;iPhone ou l&amp;rsquo;Android qui est le mieux ?
La réponse est simple : Il n&amp;rsquo;y en a pas un mieux que l&amp;rsquo;autre, tout dépends de l&amp;rsquo;utilisation que l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites faire de son téléphone</description>

Ca fesait 5 ans que j&amp;rsquo;étais sous iOS (iPhone) et je me suis fais controler mon esprit par un ami (encore sur iPhone). Et me voila avec un samsung galaxy s2 sous Android depuis hier soir.
Android a de bons cotés avec ses fonctionnalité avancées, mais des choses toute conne comme un bon client mail, impossible de mettre la main dessus :-(</description>

 Une section Packages vient de voir le jour dans la partie Linux (il était temps !) Une petite documentation sur comment utiliser un DVD Redhat comme repository Une autre sur comment compiler et créer un RPM depuis des sources (exemple avec le projet Openonload) Une petite modification sur l&amp;rsquo;utilisation sur ZFS ARC Cache avec ZFS on Linux Et enfin un petit script pour updater automatiquement les hosts sur Visage (Collectd)  </description>

      <description>Parce qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a marre de cette recherche minable dans MediaWiki, que j&amp;rsquo;ai bougé mes petites fesses et créer une extension pour ajouter à la &amp;ldquo;sidebar&amp;rdquo; : une recherche Google.
Il vous faudra bien entendu être inscrit au Google CSE ou encore Adsense pour pouvoir profiter de la recherche personnalisée. L&amp;rsquo;extension est bien entendue accessible sur Mediawiki ou mon git :
 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GoogleSearch

  L&amp;rsquo;installation est vraiment simple, donc n&amp;rsquo;hésitez pas !</description>

      <description>Et bah voilà, ça fait un moment que ça me trottait dans la tête de mettre en place un Puppet Dashboard, même si pour certaines personnes ça ne sert pas à grand chose. Ca permet au moins d&amp;rsquo;avoir une idée de comment se passe les synchronisations pour les fonctionnalités les plus basiques.
Une autre interface que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé existe, appelée The Forman.
Je testerais peut être plus tard cette interface, mais pour l&amp;rsquo;heure, voici la documentation pour Puppet Dashboard.</description>

      <description>Après m’être acharné sur du GlusterFS, du DRBD+OCFS2 etc… je suis revenu à des choses plus conventionnelles et plus simple à gérer. J’ai donc testé Unison qui m’avait pas trop fait kiffé il y a quelques années du fait que si on veut une synchronisation parfaite, ce n’est pas possible.
Bref, aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui je pense que c&amp;rsquo;est un bon compromis pour ce que je souhaites faire donc voici une petite documentation comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude pour l&amp;rsquo;utilisation standard.</description>

      <description>En février dernier, un groupe de députés européens baptisé LEWP (Law Enforcement Working Party) a commencé à travailler en secret sur un projet de loi dont l’objectif est de mettre en place un grand firewall européen. Soutenus par les lobbies américains, ce projet de loi aura pour but d’exclure d’Europe certains sites internet considérés comme illégaux. Tous les FAI devront alors se plier à cette loi et appliquer ce filtrage Européen.</description>

      <description>Collectd c’est le bien. Mais les interfaces web manquent cruellement de maturité comparé à Munin. Un petit pointe le bout de son nez de plus en plus et se démarque des autres (à mon goût), c’est Visage.
Il manque encore quelques fonctionnalités, mais celles pour comparer ou visualiser un host fonctionnent à merveille. Comme à mon habitude, voici une documentation.</description>

      <description>Youhou quel titre ! Il y a quelques années, un de mes collègues avait cherché le moyen de faire de la réécriture d&amp;rsquo;URL (ce qui fonctionnait plutôt bien), mais sans cacher le numéro du port.
Pour toi public, voici donc la solution. Il faut tout simplement utiliser le module proxy d&amp;rsquo;Apache pour faire une réécriture d&amp;rsquo;URL. La documentation est ici.</description>

      <description>J’ai fais un petit essai ce week end de ma Z1000 en full power. J’ai pu obtenir les infos en fouillant un peu sur le net.
Alors les impressions : un peu déçu. Effectivement, je pensais que ça allait envoyer beaucoup plus fort. C&amp;rsquo;est mieux c&amp;rsquo;est sur, mais en prenant 40cv de plus, je m&amp;rsquo;attendais à bien mieux.
Donc au final, la poignée de gaz n&amp;rsquo;est plus limitée (le plus gros bridage est ici), et une cosse a retirée qui permet d&amp;rsquo;améliorer l&amp;rsquo;air dans le moteur (c&amp;rsquo;est ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai lu sur le net, j&amp;rsquo;en suis pas sur à 100%).</description>

Ça fait des mois que je suis en test chez moi, ça fonctionne plutôt bien. La semaine dernière j&amp;rsquo;ai reçu un mail d&amp;rsquo;un certain David qui me demandait une version qui fonctionnait sur MediaWiki 1.16.
Il l&amp;rsquo;a donc mis à jour avec succès et ça fonctionne très bien :-)
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, la dernière version est donc disponible sur mon git.</description>

      <description>Si vous souhaitez gagner de précieuses secondes sur le chargements de vos pages web, il est fortement recommander d’utiliser la compression. Il faut également choisir les éléments que vous voulez compresser.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;ai encore fait un petit article flash éclair pour Lighty et PHP5 :
 Compression pour PHP5/Apache

      <description>Je ne le répèterais jamais assez, vérifiez votre installation et configuration et testez là ensuite !
Je suis confronté actuellement à un serveur qui passe son temps à se faire hacker. J&amp;rsquo;ai du auditer la sécurité de celui ci et je me rends compte que beaucoup de personne néglige les aspects de la sécurité. Pourquoi tant d&amp;rsquo;acharnement ? Faut dire aussi :
 Pas de Firewall
 Pas de modules de sécurité</description>

Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui les enfants, nous allons voir comment faire des mails d&amp;rsquo;alerte class mais pas trop lourd non plus :
On peut donc faire des emails en HTML avec des liens (ouaaa), on peut même mettre des images et couplé à nagios graph, on peut même les mettre dedans (ohhhh !!!). Bref, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite doc pour une installation flash éclair : Nagios : Améliorer le look des notifications</description>

      <description>Le TRIM permet de modifier le comportement de l’OS avec un disque SSD. Sur Mac OS X, aujourd’hui il n’y a que les SSD “Apple” qui ont cette techno. Le but de cette instruction est de maintenir la vitesse du SSD tout au long de sa vie, évitant le ralentissement que les premiers modèles rencontraient une fois que toutes les cellules étaient écrites au moins une fois.
Heureusement, d&amp;rsquo;autres gens s&amp;rsquo;y sont pencher pour l&amp;rsquo;activer sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel type de SSD.</description>

Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, je suis sous FreeBSD et je ne suis pas convaincu vu les bugs auxquels je me suis confronté (certainement du à l&amp;rsquo;émulation de couches basses Linux). Je me tourne donc vers ZFS on Linux.</description>

Vous connaissez déjà peut être Rancid qui permet de faire des backups de vos chers équipements Cisco et de les stocker dans un VCS. Au taf, mon équipe réseaux se plaignait de ne pas pouvoir faire de recherche dans tous les équipements cisco d&amp;rsquo;un coup. Imaginez plusieurs équipements avec pour certain plus de 25000 lignes d&amp;rsquo;ACL et autre configuration VPN.</description>

Il vous permet d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement des logiciels, faire leur configuration et changer l&amp;rsquo;état d&amp;rsquo;un service.
Je viens d&amp;rsquo;énumérer même pas 5% de ce que Puppet est capable de faire. Bref, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà une doc sur mon wiki que je viens d&amp;rsquo;actualiser avec un peu plus d&amp;rsquo;explications et une version squeeze.</description>

      <description>Bonjour à tous !
J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour mon wiki avec ma configuration Nagios. Vous allez me dire : &amp;ldquo;Atta&amp;hellip; pouquoi t&amp;rsquo;fais ça, yen a plein sule net, c&amp;rsquo;est po la peine hein !&amp;rdquo;. C&amp;rsquo;est vrai qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a plein sur le net, c&amp;rsquo;est pour ça que la mienne n&amp;rsquo;est pas bourrée d&amp;rsquo;explications et surtout un peu plus particulière que la majorité qu&amp;rsquo;on trouve sur internet.
Etant utilisateur, administrateur et développeur de plugins, ma forte expérience sur Nagios m&amp;rsquo;a permit d&amp;rsquo;apprendre à moduler, simplifier et rendre flexible ma configuration Nagios.</description>

      <description>Ca fait un moment que ça me trotte dans la tête et voilà, je me suis décidé à mettre ceci en place.
Mon but est d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement les mises à jour de sécurité. Évidement il n&amp;rsquo;est pas vraiment recommandé de faire ce genre de chose, mais sur une Debian, qui est en version stable et ou seul les mise à jour de sécurité sont installées&amp;hellip; on limite les risques.
Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d&amp;rsquo;un outil permettant de faire de genre de choses et je suis tombé sur cron-apt.</description>

      <description>J’avais commencé à faire mon nouveau serveur avant de déménager, mais n’avais pas trop eu le temps d’en parler.
Pour être plus gentil avec la planète et avec mon compte en banque, j&amp;rsquo;ai décidé (idée de ma femme) de migrer mon serveur sur un Mac Mini.
Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas tant besoin de puissance que ça et qu&amp;rsquo;avec les Core 2 Duo qu&amp;rsquo;il y a dans l&amp;rsquo;avant dernière génération (celle que j&amp;rsquo;ai), en y ajoutant un peu de RAM (4Go au total) et un disque qui tient la route (500Go 7200trs/min), ça devrait tenir à l&amp;rsquo;aise le coup.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris une petite documentation sur GlusterFS sur comment répliquer le /var/www. Dans la pratique c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien :

Au début j&amp;rsquo;ai pensé à des produits commerciaux que l&amp;rsquo;on peut trouver dans n&amp;rsquo;importe quelle grande surface un peu spécialisée. Je connais bien les problématiques, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas toujours stable, c&amp;rsquo;est pauvre en options&amp;hellip;
Je possède une Soekris et j&amp;rsquo;en suis très content. Mais le fait d&amp;rsquo;avoir choisis OpenBSD est un choix personnel qui ne correspond pas vraiment à celui de mon ami car pas très user friendly.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai une très mauvaise expérience actuellement avec FreeBSD. J&amp;rsquo;ai effectuer plusieurs tests hard avant de remettre sur FreeBSD.
Pourquoi avais je pris FreeBSD au lieu de Debian ? :
 Pour le ZFS
 Sa réputation
 Pour essayer
  Seulement voilà, quand on commence à faire du fuse + encfs + sshfs&amp;hellip;bah c&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi stable qu&amp;rsquo;on est en droit de penser. J&amp;rsquo;ai des kernel panic qui ne font même pas rebooter ma machine (alors que c&amp;rsquo;est pourtant le comportement par défaut de FreeBSD) visiblement à cause de Fuse ou SSHfs et c&amp;rsquo;est très handicapant.</description>

http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/820-7197-12&amp;frasl;820-7197-12.pdf
Ensuite, un collègue m&amp;rsquo;a filé ce lien qui permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir les best practice pour faire du RAID 6 :
http://www.filibeto.org/sun/lib/blueprints/820-5825.pdf
Tout ça pour faire du vmware. Il a donc fallu changer le mode de visualisation de la baie par les hosts en vmware et idem encore utiliser les recommandations de Vmware par rapport aux LUN etc&amp;hellip; :</description>

      <description>Il semblerait que du côté de Debian 6 une nomenclature se fasse pour les interfaces réseaux évoluées. J&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré un problème avec mes interfaces bridgées qui n&amp;rsquo;utilisaient pas des noms &amp;ldquo;génériques&amp;rdquo;. En fait les scripts de base proposés par Debian comportent en dur des noms qu&amp;rsquo;il est préférable d&amp;rsquo;utiliser.

Rien de grave, mais j’ai quand même mal a la cheville (j’me suis prit le sélecteur) et au coude (le poid de la moto a été retenu avec).
Bref ce matin ça fait mal, et vais peut être aller voir le médecin quand même.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une présentation afin d&amp;rsquo;expliquer à mon équipe comment travailler en Scrum et ai adapté le tout pour une équipe Sysnet.
Il est nécessaire d&amp;rsquo;avoir quelques connaissances dans les méthodes agiles et particulièrement Scrum avant d&amp;rsquo;aborder ma présentation.</description>

      <description>Une petite blagounette en ce jour maussade :-(. Je viens de rentrer de vacances et me suis fait cambriolé le lendemain de mon départ. Le tableau est assez moche, gros chantier de fringues, matelas retourné, Playstation, portable et bijoux volés.
Bref, je contemple les dégâts et vais prendre les mesure qui s&amp;rsquo;impose pour ne plus que ça arrive.
Dur journée :-(</description>

      <description>C’est un peu ce que diraient les poulet ricains pour ce qui est de la prochaine mouture de Debian. Car youpi tralala Debian 6 vient de freezer en version testing. Maintenant, il n’y aura donc que des corrections de bugs et de failles de secu.
Et ça tombe super bien ça ! Parce que je viens de réinstaller mon serveur (sur mon mac mini) et j&amp;rsquo;ai justement utiliser Debian 6 (je ferais un post bientôt là dessus).</description>

      <description>Ca fait depuis un moment que je dois faire ça et ça y est. J’ai donc comme d’habitude, pondu une petite documentation qui explique comment on l’installe et le paramètre.
C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment une doc rapide sans trop d&amp;rsquo;explication. Cependant, je conseil plus que fortement de monitorer la base MySQL qui peut rapidement grandir et avoir besoin de tuning si jamais vous avez pas mal de checks.</description>

      <description>Je commence vraiment à utiliser collectd et il faut absolument une belle interface qui fait pas mal de trucs. Seulement voilà, le problème c’est que malgré qu’il y ai une 10 d’interfaces, elles sont toutes assez moche et peu fonctionnelle. Bref, il faut en utiliser plusieurs pour avoir un truc sympas.
Voici celles qui m&amp;rsquo;ont semblées intéressantes :
 Collection3  Interface simpliste, mais utile. C&amp;rsquo;est celle de base qui est plus ou moins recommandé par Collectd.</description>

Cependant, le problème majeure est la connexion internet :-(. Je n&amp;rsquo;ai que 4,8Mb/s au lieu de 20Mb/s. Ca calme :-(. J&amp;rsquo;ai beau bidouiller tous me cables téléphonique, mais rien n&amp;rsquo;y fait, pas moyen de faire mieux snif.
A part ça, j&amp;rsquo;ai de la place pour faire pleins de trucs, c&amp;rsquo;est cool. Ma femme est contente. Le chat est ravit :-)</description>

      <description>Moi je connais un mec qui ce week end a fait un petit reboot (pour simplifier la situation) de son serveur qu’il a chez lui. En faisant le reboot 2 disques de sont raid 5 sont endommagés (1 qui fait clic clic et l’autre visiblement le problème de firmware Seagate….il avait pourtant flashé à l’époque pour ne pas que ça arrive).
Il essaye donc d&amp;rsquo;en faire repartir 1 et par miracle il y arrive.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc prévu une petite doc à cet effet pour ceux que ça intéresse. J&amp;rsquo;ai été aidé de Luc (un presta qui depuis a fait quelques commentaires sur le blog) et ai enrichi un peu le tout.</description>

Même si ça a quelques contraintes de confidentialités, on peut générer de vrais certificats SSL reconnu nativement (dans la liste des autorités de certification) sur tout bon browser web qui se respecte.
Il y a plusieurs niveau, gratuits et payant. Le niveau gratuit permet de faire déjà pas mal de trucs, je vous laisse consulter ma doc si vous voulez faire de même et le site (StarCom) si vous voulez en savoir plus.</description>

Je savais pertinemment que le C ou le C++ étaient plus rapide, mais par rapports aux autre langages plus ou moins interprétés, je ne savais pas. Après une très rapide recherche, j’ai la réponse à ma question :

      <description>Pendant des années, j’ai adoré la simplicité de Munin. Et puis au fil du temps, avec les besoins du taf et notamment Solaris, ça devient de plus en plus galère de l’installer et d’avoir des graphs très précis. Je suis tombé sur cet article qui parle de Collectd.
Je me suis donc intéressé à la chose et suis très satisfait du résultat. C&amp;rsquo;est très rapide, il existe plusieurs interfaces graphiques (plus ou moins jolie, plus ou moins fonctionnelles) et surtout, il y a une tonne de modules de base pour Collectd !</description>

      <description>Suite à un précédent post, c’est super de faire des schéma en ASCII, mais des fois on aimerait bien les avoir en version un peu plus propre. On va donc éviter de tout refaire hein :-) ! Et c’est là que Ditaa entre en jeu ! Il est écrit en java et permet simplement une conversion. Voici l’exemple d’un schéma ASCII :

J&amp;rsquo;ai pour l&amp;rsquo;instant fait une petite doc (qui est plus que très proche de la doc officielle tellement elle est bien faite) qui résume comment s&amp;rsquo;y prendre pour faire booter son FreeBSD sur du RAIDZ.</description>

      <description>J’ai eu une petite mésaventure depuis quelques mois au taf avec ce merveilleux filesystem qu’est ZFS. Le problème est simple, j’ai des machines à 72Go de RAM et ne peut dépasser ~ les 48Go.
Comment ça se fait ? Tout simplement parce que ZFS se réserve 1&amp;frasl;8 de la mémoire dispo (RAM+SWAP) pour son cache. Sur des petites config ça ne se voit pas mais sur des machines avec autant de RAM, ça ait mal.</description>

      <description>Sans parler des terminaux qui sont à des années lumières des téléphones portables classiques, le serveur c’est vraiment une merde. Ca s’améliore d’année en année, mais quand même… quelle merde !
C&amp;rsquo;est buggé a mort. Tous les outils de diagnostiques disent que tout fonctionne, et pourtant, aucuns mails relayé. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite doc avec tous les prérequis, les check à faire&amp;hellip;
Pour ma part, tous les checks disaient que tout fonctionnaient bien mais il m&amp;rsquo;a fallu appliquer un Service Pack pour que tout refonctionne.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai déjà encore galérer pour foutre ce putain de PXE. J&amp;rsquo;ai pourtant suivit ma doc que j&amp;rsquo;avais faite précédemment, mais là, rien à faire, le PXE ne voulait pas être reconnu. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc décider d&amp;rsquo;en faire un sous OpenBSD (OpenBSD pour installer OpenBSD, quoi de plus naturelle&amp;hellip;) et vais améliorer la doc ici.</description>

Encore une fois, c&amp;rsquo;est avec VIM que tout se fait, il existe un petit plugin qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle Drawit.
J&amp;rsquo;ai été gentil, vu que j&amp;rsquo;ai un peu galérer pour l&amp;rsquo;installation j&amp;rsquo;ai mis les fichiers sur mon git et ai même fait une petite doc qui va bien.</description>

      <description>SSLH est comme un tour de magie. Il permet par exemple sur une adresse WAN sur le port 443 d’avoir du HTTPS et du SSH. Comment c’est possible ??? On peut mettre un même port d’écoute sur un même port !
Effectivement ! Il faut simplement voir SSLH comme un proxy de couche 7 capable de filtrer et différencier les trames SSL des trames SSH.
Et voici une petite documentation et un correctif pour OpenBSD.</description>

Voilà donc un plugin qui permet de parser un fichier, et de garder ou non les lignes qui nous intéressent. En plus de celà on peut spécifier, s&amp;rsquo;il faut un certain nombre de lignes pour que le plugin retourne une valeur positive.</description>

Je regrette que cette fonctionnalité là n&amp;rsquo;existe pas sur Linux.</description>

      <description>Et bien me voilà encore en pleine créativité, on ne m’arrête plus !!!! Pour la petite histoire, il y a maintenant peut être 2 ans, je cherchais une extension pour MediaWiki me permettant de supprimer mon historique. J’avais trouvé l’extension parfaite SpecialDeleteOldRevisions, mais lors d’une upgrade, impossible de la faire fonctionner correctement. Toujours pas d’update de cette extension 1 an après. Je m’étais dis que j’en ferais une un de ces 4.</description>

      <description>Bon clairement, j’ai récemment fait des videos pour le blog de ma fille en FLV (flash) sous Linux. Je vous passe les détails cauchemardesques pour faire des rotations de video, sans parler de la conversion dans ce format à la con, mais qui est aujourd’hui massivement utilisé.
Puis je me suis souvenu que le HTML 5 arrivait à grand pas et qu&amp;rsquo;il y avait un support video. Je me suis donc penché un peu plus sur la question et voilà ce que je trouver : 2 formats existent pour le moment OGV (Libre et gratuit) et H264 (Payant à l&amp;rsquo;utilisation, mais vu que je suis un particulier etc&amp;hellip; personne ira vérifier, surtout pour des videos perso).</description>

      <description>J’en ai eu marre de taper toujours et encore du code pour avoir de la numérotation de ligne commençant par 0 sur ma colorisation syntaxique de code avec GeSHi. En l’absence de documentation sur l’extension SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi j’ai du me farcir le code à la mainet trouver comment setter des valeurs par défaut. J’ai donc maintenant “line=1 start=0” à tous mes codes sur mon wiki sans me prendre la tête à l’écrire à chaque fois.</description>

      <description>Je viens de faire joujou avec Nginx suite à l’article dans dernier Linux Mag et parce que je vais m’en servir avec Puppet. Et bah c’est plutôt super bien foutu. J’ai été très étonné par la simplicité de la configuration par rapport à Apache qui au fil du temps est devenu une grosse usine à gaz. Avec Lighttpd, ils deviennent des alternatives vraiment sérieuses à Apache avec surtout les performances et optimisation des ressources nettement meilleures.</description>

      <description>J’ai concocté un petit script permettant d’optimiser toutes les tables de ses bases MySQL. Mon petit script récupère les noms des bases de données, liste les tables et optimise tout ce petit monde pour gagner de l’espace sur le disque :-). Bref, je ne vais pas expliquer de long en large ce que fait la fonction ‘OPTIMIZE’ de MySQL mais en gros l’idée est là.
Pour trouver ce petit script, je vous invite à suivre ce liens.</description>

      <description>Dans un précédent post, j’expliquais comment faire des exe sous Windows. Je vais donc expliquer pourquoi :
Dans ma boite, j&amp;rsquo;ai des personnes mal intentionnées qui avaient les droits admin de leur machine. Le problème c&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;avec ça ils peuvent en faire des conneries&amp;hellip;
Pour palier à ce problème, on les a mis en utilisateurs. Et pour ne pas que si quelqu&amp;rsquo;un trouve le mot de passe admin, qu&amp;rsquo;il puisse se connecter sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel ordinateur pour prendre des informations, il faut un mot de passe unique par ordinateur.</description>

      <description>J’ai fais mes débuts en Perl sous Windows fin de cette semaine et j’avoue que c’est quand même vachement bien ce que Monsieur Larry et sa Team a fait. Le portage de Perl sur Windows est vraiment très bien fait et ça fonctionne quasiment pareil que sur les *nix. Biensure, il y a quelques petites différences comme les chemins des dossiers etc…, mais franchement, du fait qu’on puisse utiliser les API Windows, c’est vraiment balaise.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation dessus pour ceux qu ça intéresse. Voici la doc sur pam_cracklib.</description>

Il est donc plus intéressant qu&amp;rsquo;ils apparaissent sur le site officiel, plutôt que l&amp;rsquo;historique, même si il m&amp;rsquo;a bien servit durant quelques mois.
Vous pouvez donc maintenant les retrouver sur http://exchange.nagios.org</description>

Actuellement sur mon serveur, je tourne avec KVM et libvirt. J&amp;rsquo;en suis plutôt très satisfait. Seulement voilà, entre MySecureShell avec lequel on doit compiler sur beaucoup de plateformes et mes autres VM dont j&amp;rsquo;ai besoin au quotidien, les 4Go de RAM de la machine ne suffisent pas forcément et je suis au maximum des capacités RAM sur celle ci.</description>

Donc voilà Chrome est sensé faire tout ce que fait Firefox, mais en mieux. Un peu septique, j&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même voulu tenter l&amp;rsquo;aventure.
Mon bilan est dressé au bout d&amp;rsquo;une heure d&amp;rsquo;utilisation.</description>

Un peu d&amp;rsquo;explication ne fait pas de mal. J&amp;rsquo;utilise depuis des années MediaWiki et en suis pleinement satisfait ! Au boulot, il y a quelques années aussi, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas réussi à faire appliquer MediaWiki car il ne prenait pas en charge le WIZIWIG et une gestion des ACLs simple.</description>

Nous avons eu besoin de lui car c&amp;rsquo;est les pertes de perfs qui nous troublaient.</description>

      <description>Depuis quelques temps je me suis mis à faire toute sorte de graphs. Vous l’avez vu dans un de mes précédents posts avec OpenChart et maintenant RRDtool. Je ne vous cacherais pas que c’est un peu complexe a prendre en main, mais une fois fait, on peut vraiment tout faire et on comprends aisément pourquoi il est utilisé partout.
Le mécanisme de base de donnée est extrêment bien pensé et surtout autonome, ce qui le rends très pratique et facile anticiper les éventuels problèmes de place liés à de multiples bases de données RRD (puisque maitrisée).</description>

      <description>J’ai découvert dans le dernier Linux Mag HS un shell permettant de limiter les accès aux commandes pour les utilisateurs. Il possède aussi quelques options pour le sftp, mais est très loin d’égaler MySecureShell.
En disposant donc MySecureShell en shell primaire, puis en déclarant lshell en shell sous-jacent (dans la conf de MySecureShell), on peut alors parfaitement maitriser les faits et gestes de nos précieux utilisateurs afin qu&amp;rsquo;ils ne fassent pas de bêtises.</description>

      <description>Bon, le titre est pas génial je sais, mais pas évident d’expliquer. Plowshare est un outil en ligne de commande permettant de télécharger tout type de fichiers sur les sites tel que rapidshare ou megaupload sans avoir à se prendre la tête. On lui balance les liens et ça roule.

PS : Un petit rappel, ne téléchargez pas de choses illégales ! (je suis un peu obligé de le dire)</description>

      <description>J’ai récemment décidé de passer un VAE pour me faire valider un BTS. Pour ça, on me demande un CV. CV que j’ai mis à jour il y a quelques temps déjà et j’en avais parlé dans des billets précédents sur ce blog (-&amp;gt; http://www.mavro.fr).
J&amp;rsquo;utilise donc le superbe Sample Resume Template qui en fait est une template HTML. Il faut donc faire pas mal de changements pour arriver à un résultat convenable.</description>

      <description>Après avoir tenter plusieurs serveurs uPNP (MediaTomb et PS3 Media Server) pour la Playstation 3, j’ai eu besoin de tester la lecture d’éléments multimedia à partir d’une clef USB.
Je copie donc mon contenu à l&amp;rsquo;arrache en me disant que la PS3 va automatiquement détecter en fonction des extensions des fichiers si c&amp;rsquo;est des photos, musiques ou films&amp;hellip;et bah non ! Quedal ! Ca marche pas vraiment comme ça. Réencoder les films ?</description>

Bref heureusement j&amp;rsquo;ai un raid 5 sur 4 disques et je n&amp;rsquo;ai qu&amp;rsquo;1 disque qui est tombé en panne. C&amp;rsquo;est donc arrivé samedi et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc racheté un disque Seagate (pas que j&amp;rsquo;aime me faire du mal, mais la série de disques défectueux est passée et en plus je trouve que les Seagate sont très très bon pour tourner 24/24h.</description>

 check_sun_cluster : qui permet de surveiller l&amp;rsquo;état du cluster sun check_multi_procs : permet de surveiller plusieurs process dans un seul check  Et puis j&amp;rsquo;ai pu en améliorer d&amp;rsquo;autres :
 check_backuppc_hosts : ajout d&amp;rsquo;une fonctionnalité pour monitorer qu&amp;rsquo;un seuil hôte  Voilà donc mes dernières œuvres.</description>

 Mylène farmer
 Edith Piaf
 Le foutage de gueule de Christophe Mahé
 La guitare électrique

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2009/12/06/vim-pour-eclipse/</guid>
      <description>Je pense avoir trouvé le plugin Eclipse qu’il me fallait. Il utilise en fait gvim. Mon problème était donc d’adapter gvim pour qu’il puisse utiliser ma conf de vim. Tout ne passait pas correctement, j’ai donc adapter comme il fallait mon .vimrc afin qu’il se rapproche au mieux de vim.
Il faut donc installer le plugin à l&amp;rsquo;adresse suivante : http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/.
Un une fois installé, il faut l&amp;rsquo;activer dans les préférences gvim, puis l&amp;rsquo;associer aux extensions de fichier souhaité.</description>

      <description>Sur les conseils de mon ami Seb (Teka), je me suis mis à utiliser un IDE pour développer dans toute sorte de language afin de gagner en souplesse et en rapidité.
Du coup, j&amp;rsquo;utilise Eclipse. Cependant, de base, il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas grand chose qui m&amp;rsquo;intéresse puisque c&amp;rsquo;est assez spécifique à Java et je ne développe pas en Java. Il existe donc tout un tas d&amp;rsquo;addons et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis sur mon wiki ceux que j&amp;rsquo;utilise.</description>

J’ai voulu upgrader comme j’avais fait à l’époque de la 4.4 vers la 4.5, à savoir en mode manuel http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade46.html#upgrade.
Même si il est clairement spécifier que ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas la méthode recommandée, je n&amp;rsquo;avais pas rencontrer de problèmes la fois d&amp;rsquo;avant.</description>

      <description>Une fois de plus, je vous livre ma petite doc qui porte cette fois ci sur les ACL Solaris. J’ai beaucoup pompé sur la doc officielle mais ai essayer de raccourcir au maximum pour raccourcir et ne prendre que ce qui est le plus vitale.
Ca donne quand même une belle doc du fait que la complexité de la chose. En effet, pas de grande similitudes avec les ACL Linux pour le côté utilisation, parcontre dans les faits, le système est assez similaire.</description>

      <description>Je suis trop content, j’avais vraiment peur que de belles technologies tombent dans l’oublie. Ce n’est pas le cas puisqu’Oracle a confirmer son maintient ET investissement dans :
 Solaris
 MySQL
 SPARC
  MySQL, j&amp;rsquo;y croyais pas du tout, mais c&amp;rsquo;est super, je suis content. J&amp;rsquo;espère qu&amp;rsquo;xVM Server va également sortir rapidement en stable etc&amp;hellip; Je trouve parcontre vraiment dommage qu&amp;rsquo;ils abandonnent OpenSolaris. C&amp;rsquo;était, je pense, une très bonne solution pour améliorer la stabilité de leurs produits finaux et intéresser un plus large publique bien que Solaris soit aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui gratuit.</description>

      <description>Solaris n’intègre pas par défaut un mécanisme de création de dossiers personnels. Il faut donc utiliser PAM Linux, le compiler et copier la librairie qui va bien. Heureusement ça marche :-)
J&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite doc pour ceux que ça intéressent.</description>

 Réplication MySQL master to master
 Un simple rsync pour les fichiers (pas encore de DRBD + OCFS2)
  Et pour ce qui est du load balancing, c&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;un simple round robin. Pas encore de Failover non plus. A venir donc.</description>

La dernière fois c’était ya ptete 5 ans chez moi. Tout ça parceque le shell il dit pas ou t’es, que ya pas de rm -i. Enfin bref, va falloir faire un shell de prod c’est sur !</description>

C’est simple, c’est une application qui tourne sous Linux/Mac/Windaube et qui te permet de mettre des fichiers (peut importe quoi) dessus et tu as 2Go disponible sur un serveur. Tu peux y accéder de n’importe ou en web, ce qui est très pratique.
Et quand tu a gouter à ce soft, tu peux difficilement t&amp;rsquo;en séparer. Et là, ils viennent de sortir l&amp;rsquo;application sur iPhone !</description>

      <description>François un de mes collègues, m’a apprit aujourd’hui que Heartbeat n’était plus maintenu depuis l’année dernière et qu’ils avaient décidés de merger avec Pacemaker pour avoir un produit encore plus abouti.
Pacemaker est en fait un espèce de Heartbeat 3 (trouvé sur la doc officelle) avec comme framework OpenAIS qui est en fait une librairie pouvant être appellée via API. Un peu à la manière de KVM/Xen et libvirt.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc une mode et ça nous replonge encore dans du temps passer à lire et lire des docs.</description>

      <description>Vendredi soir, je suis allé au concert du groupe de Steeves. C’était plutôt pas mal du tout pour une première. Ils étaient donc au Fallen Fest et j’espère qu’ils gagneront le prochain live jusqu’a l’album
C&amp;rsquo;est assez bourrin comme musique, mais c&amp;rsquo;est pas QUE du bruit, donc c&amp;rsquo;est très sympas. Le plus beau c&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;ils passent pour le second tour à la boule noir !!!
A quand l&amp;rsquo;album ?</description>

J’arrive près de république et les 4 voies se rétrécissent seulement sur 2 voies avec un virage à gauche. Un car est à ma gauche, un scooter à droite et une voiture en face qui est bloquée par le car en train de tourner en prenant toute la place.</description>

      <description>Solaris est super évolué sur certaines technos, mais alors sur certains trucs comme les packages, c’est une horreur ! Exemple :
 Très mauvaise gestion des dépendances
 Pas de repository (je parle en natif, sinon il existe pkgget)
 Pas d&amp;rsquo;utilisation simple
  Bref, un bon coup de pied au cul leur ferait pas de mal à Sun. Espérons que le rachat par Oracle améliorera les points archaïque qui mette à ce bel OS des coups de freins à tous ceux qui voudraient l&amp;rsquo;utiliser.</description>

Je le met dans mon lecteur Blueray et aucuns lecteurs multimedia ne sais le lire. Why ?

J&amp;rsquo;ai le truc qu&amp;rsquo;il vous faut, c&amp;rsquo;est en flash, ça génère des graphs trop classe, bref le kiffe. Ca s&amp;rsquo;appelle Open Flash Chart. Le nom est pas très originale certe, mais au moins ça a le mérite d&amp;rsquo;être beau et efficace.

      <description>Bon, je pense avoir ma doc suffisamment éprouvée maintenant sur Sun Cluster. Je risque de faire quelques petits ajouts mineurs dans quelques temps. Mais pour l’instant, voici ma doc :
Documentation on Sun Cluster
Je vous suggère, si vous savez comment fonctionne un cluster de lire ma doc si c&amp;rsquo;est la première fois que vous faites une install, car il faut se tirer les cheveux quelques fois avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver à faire une installe propre par rapport aux exigences de Sun.</description>

      <description>Voilà mon nouveau jouet. A peine arrivé, dèjà éventré pour mettre un disque SSD. Et bah je suis sur le cul, ça trace a mort ! Quelques petites photos du SSD :
Du SSD (en haut) et de l&amp;rsquo;ancien disque (en bas) :

On l&amp;rsquo;ouvre avec quelques vis et on a accès à tout, chapeau Dell !</description>

      <description>Oui, les proxy ça fait joli, mais c’est chiant grave ! Surtout quand t’es au boulot et que tu veux faire des connections SSH dans tous les sens et que seul le port 443 est ouvert.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc trouvé une petite astuce pour bypasser tout ça, je vous invite à lire ma doc.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai fais une tite doc par rapport à ce que j&amp;rsquo;avais trouvé pour faire croire à l&amp;rsquo;opérateur que c&amp;rsquo;est bien votre iphone qui emet des requêtes de type data et non un partage qui serait détecté. Au final, des économies.

      <description>Voilà que nous approchons de notre fin de séjour a Moorea. Très très beau !
On a nagé avec des dophins&amp;hellip;exeptionnel ! On dirait des chiens d&amp;rsquo;eau tellement ils sont bien dressés. Bref nos réels impressions de vive voix.
Demain on part pour Huahine et Internet risque de ne pas être de la fête (should be not to the party).
Chloë et moi sommes malade (chacun sa maladie) mais somme en voie de guérison sous antibio.</description>

On a volé dans un tout petit avion dont le temps de vol était inférieur à 10 min. J&amp;rsquo;ai bien aimé et pense troquer ma moto contre un avion pour aller travailler :-p</description>

A part ça il fait beau, chaud et les gens extrêmement gentil !

      <description>Pour ceux qui ne savent pas, je suis le co-fondateur du projet MySecureShell.
Mon précédent post parlait de l&amp;rsquo;environnement et du film Home qui m&amp;rsquo;a déclenché l&amp;rsquo;envie d&amp;rsquo;accélérer un projet que j&amp;rsquo;ai commencé il y a quelques mois maintenant appellé phpWOL (php Wake On Lan).
Je vais le continuer en partenaria avec Teka (Sébastien), mon ami avec qui je fais MySecureShell également afin d&amp;rsquo;accélérer son développement.
phpWOL a pour but de démarrer des machines à distance.</description>

      <description>Pour ceux qui n’ont pas encore vu le film, je le conseil vivement ! Vous pouvez même l’acheter vu le prix du film (5 € le DVD) !
Je vous résume la chose, il faut aller vite et commencer maintenant ! On a moins de 10 ans pour que les choses changent !
Plutôt que de longs discours, regardez le films. Ceux qui ne savent pas quoi faire pour améliorer les choses, renseignez vous, il existe 1001 façons de le faire.</description>

      <description>Et bah voilà, je m’essaye a la vidéo en Full HD avec iMovie et iDVD.
Je dois dire que c&amp;rsquo;est assez séduisant a première vue. En tout cas iMovie est bluffant. Je n&amp;rsquo;avais pas essayé depuis la version 6 et les changements sont énormes (dans le bon sens).
Je travaille sur ma journée d&amp;rsquo;enterrement de vie de garçon avec iMovie et m&amp;rsquo;eclate avec les effets.
Il me reste iDVD a tester et j&amp;rsquo;avoue avoir quelques appréhensions avec le Full HD.</description>

      <description>Hier soir, je rentre et ma femme me dit : “Tu tombes bien, ça fait 2 min que ton serveur fait un bruit bizzard”. Et franchement entre la musique de ses Sims (dont la maison prenait feu) et le serveur, j’avais du mal à distinguer le bruit du serveur tellement c’était la première fois que j’entendais ce bruit là.
Une fois le son des Sims coupés (:-p) j&amp;rsquo;étais ennuyé parce que le bruit ne me disait vraiment pas grand chose.</description>

      <description>Ca fait déjà quelques temps que je me dis que je n’ai encore jamais testé l’iSCSi, qu’il serait peut être temps, mais que les retours que l’on m’a fait dessus n’était pas spécialement glorieux.
Ce matin en lisant mes news google reader habituelles, c&amp;rsquo;est howtoforge qui nous pond un article sur l&amp;rsquo;ATA Over Ethernet. Je trouvais que le nom sonnait bien.
Je commence à faire quelques petites recherches, déjà la mise en place parait relativement aisée, plutôt bon point, cependant, le débit n&amp;rsquo;a pas l&amp;rsquo;air délirant et apparemment il existe quelques petits problèmes de rapidité (certainement dû à la jeunesse) pour le moment.</description>

Je suis certain que c&amp;rsquo;est dû aux images qcow2 (ceux qui me disent &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo;est à cause de tes disques&amp;rsquo; peuvent remballer leur langue car pour rappel, je suis en raid5 sur 4 disques).
Malheureusement, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas de preuves pour affirmer ce que je dis plus haut, mais c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt l&amp;rsquo;experience que j&amp;rsquo;ai avec les images disques qui me faire dire ça.</description>

Depuis quelques temps, mon ami Momo (pour ceux qui le connaissent) me parle de Centreon par ci, Centreon par là, &amp;ldquo;quand est-ce que tu me le met en place etc&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.
Chaque chose en son temps ! D&amp;rsquo;abord ca a été Nagios pour lui, et maintenant on aperçoit le bout du nez de Centreon. Pour rappel, il permet de faire une conf tout en graphique de Nagios et permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir des graphs sur l&amp;rsquo;historique (pour résumer vulgairement).</description>

      <description>FreeNas est une distribution FreeBSD remodelée pour faire un l’équivalent d’un NAS. Et le résultat est assez bluffant :
 Mis en place en * de 2 min
 Mise à dispo d&amp;rsquo;une interface web belle et simple
 Pleins de protocoles intégrés
 Légère
  Ca me donne envie de me faire un PC et de dédier à ça (émuler une baie de stockage quoi).
Il y a une autre solution vieillissante aparement aussi (j&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé) qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle OpenFiler qui a l&amp;rsquo;air d&amp;rsquo;être dans le même goût mais avec une documentation payante (un peu la blague).</description>

 La sélection de texte qui copie automatiquement dans le presse papier (clipboard)
 Le bouton gauche de la souris qui effectue un coller du clipboard
  Et bien ces 2 trucs là, je galère depuis longtemps à les retrouver et je pensais enfin avoir réussi.</description>

      <description>Suite à mon précédent post sur le versionning, j’ai donc décidé en mon âme et conscience, de choisir Git.
Je dois avoué que je suis assez surpris par les nouvelles fonctionnalités qui changent un peu de SVN, mais c&amp;rsquo;est quand même vraiment pas mal !
J&amp;rsquo;entends la foule crier au loin &amp;ldquo;la doc, la doc&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, oui oui elle est là et prête : Doc sur Git
Ouali oulaou, que ceux qu&amp;rsquo;on des questions n&amp;rsquo;aysyttepeua !</description>

      <description>Je suis tiraillé entre plusieurs trucs. J’aimerais mettre un soft de versionning pour tout ce que je développe. Seulement voilà, je ne sais pas bien quoi mettre au juste :
 CVS : vieux, plus vraiment mis à jour, mais standart
 SVN : plus récent, plus performant que CVS mais qui commence déjà à vieillir, mais standart aussi
 Git : encore plus récent, plus performant, moins gourmand en disque qu&amp;rsquo;SVN ?</description>

 Pour tester votre multipathing (utile pour les liens Fibres sur les SAN)
  J&amp;rsquo;espère que ces premières versions vont plaires. Le check de Backuppc a déjà pas mal de downloads :-)</description>

      <description>Bon… allez, je vais vous expliquer déjà pourquoi j’ai refais mon serveur.
Dans mes précédents posts datant du mois de décembre, vous avez pu lire que j&amp;rsquo;étais passé de mon serveur Debian 32 bits etch (stable de l&amp;rsquo;époque) vers Solaris et adoptant la virtualisation avec VirtualBox le temps de patienter pour xVM Server.
Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, xVM Server n&amp;rsquo;est toujours pas sorti, VirtualBox n&amp;rsquo;est vraiment, vraiment pas fait pour de la pseudo prod (donc imaginez la prod), contrairement à ce qui est dit sur le site officiel de Sun.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, je contribue. C’est rare car je n’ai pas toujours le temps de faire quelque chose de générique, mais là c’est le cas, donc j’en fais profiter tout le monde.
J&amp;rsquo;ai développer un plugins Nagios pour checker l&amp;rsquo;état de bon fonctionnement de BackupPC. J&amp;rsquo;ai fais avec les moyens du bord et je suis sûr qu&amp;rsquo;il y a moyen de faire plus simple.
En attendant, voici le lien : http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Backup-and-Recovery/BackupPC/check_backuppc_hosts/details</description>

      <description>Je reviens du spectacle de Dieudonné et franchement c’était géniale, je vous conseil d’aller le voir :
En plus son théatre est vraiment bien foutu, peut importe ou on se trouve, on voit. C&amp;rsquo;est assez petit, donc très très sympas. Je trouve ça mieux qu&amp;rsquo;un stade de France quoi.
Petit b mol à la France qui se dit pays des libertés. Depuis quelques années ces libertés disparaissent petit à petit. Déjà que pour Dieudo, à part jouer dans son propre théatre, il ne peut plus se produire, mais c&amp;rsquo;est maintenant au tour de ses DVD qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;a plus le droit de vendre dans le commerce.</description>

      <description>Bon là ça y est, j’en peux plus !
Je viens de vendre mon mac par exemple et voici ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai comme problèmes :
 Les transferts en SSH déconnent (s&amp;rsquo;arrête au bout d&amp;rsquo;un certain temps) avec Cyberduck.
 Sur le serveur, j&amp;rsquo;ai une clef USB branchée dessus, c&amp;rsquo;est ultra lent pour copier un truc.
 Aucunes souplesses avec Solaris.
  Donc voilà, ça y est, ça fait un moment que j&amp;rsquo;en parle, il me faut du temps pour refaire mon serveur là.</description>

 Les pertes de perfs réseaux
 Les problèmes de paravirtualisation VT sous VirtualBox
 Les perfs en générale
  J&amp;rsquo;en peux plus. C&amp;rsquo;est super décourageant. Alors maintenant on va se poser les vrais questions :
 OS : Debian 5, ya pas à tortiller du cul pour chier droit
 FileSystem + Redondance : LVM+RAID5 Software ou FUSE+ZFS</description>

Bon évidement j&amp;rsquo;ai pas repris tout ce que j&amp;rsquo;avais réussi à perdre, sans quoi je me serais déjà pendu. Cependant, je suis à 75,5kg.
J&amp;rsquo;ai un petit soft sur mon iPhone qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle Weightbot et qui me graffe ma progression (bon pas RRDTool non plus).
De plus, j&amp;rsquo;ai une nouvelle balance qui me fait la totale : masse musculaire, osseuse, graisseuse etc&amp;hellip; je kiffe.</description>

      <description>Hé bé voilà, ç y est. Chez moi la Soekris est en place et tout fonctionne presque. Il reste encore un peu de boulot côté PF, mais dans l’ensemble c’est bien.
Bon, je vais pouvoir allez dormir car demain boulot à 8h00 :-(</description>

      <description>J’ai reçu ma bébete mercredi ainsi que ma carte Compact Flash.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc tout installé dans la boiboite et après une soirée de beuverie pour le nouvel an et 5h de sommeil, je me suis dis qu&amp;rsquo;il était temps d&amp;rsquo;installer le monstre. Sur les conseils de David qui m&amp;rsquo;a fournit les &amp;ldquo;soit disant bons&amp;rdquo; cables pour connecter la Soekris à mon PC, il aurait été normal que je le remercie, mais là nan !</description>

      <description>Bonne année à tous ! Je vous souhaites tout ce qu’il y a de mieux pour vous !
Cette année risque d&amp;rsquo;être riche en rebondissements, autant sur le plan technique que dans ma vie personnelle (mon mariage :-)).</description>

 Mise à dispo de VMs à Seb et Stival pour tous les tests Cluster HA

      <description>Et bien me voilà de retour. Bon tout est loin d’être terminé, mais je sais où je vais maintenant. Voici donc ce qui a été fait :
 Le serveur tourne maintenant sous Solaris en ZFS sur le disque primaire
 Sur les 4 autres disques de 1To, il y a un Raidz (ça trace sa maman)
 OpenBSD sous VirtualBox comme frontal a été abandonné. Pourquoi ? Bein, c&amp;rsquo;est soit disant supporté, mais je me tapes tout le temps des Segmentation Fault.</description>

      <description>Oyé oyé,
Demain je refais mon serveur, voici les modifs :
 Passage de 2To de données en single HDD à 3To en raid5
 Migration Debian etch 32 bits vers Solaris x86_64
 Mise en place de VMs :
 OpenBSD 4.4
 Debian (ou ubuntu server, je ne sais pas trop encore)
  Il y aura donc des perturbations pendant quelques jours, voir toute la semaine prochaine. Je vous tiens au courant de l&amp;rsquo;évolution&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>J’ai enfin terminé de rédiger mon Introduction à Perl.
J&amp;rsquo;ai commencé à lire le bouquin été 2007, ai dans la foulée commencé à rédiger ce concentré. Bon évidement j&amp;rsquo;ai commencé d&amp;rsquo;autres bouquins tel que le PHP sur lequel je dois finir d&amp;rsquo;écrire également le résumer sur mon wiki. Je serais pas obligé de faire tout ça si la partie de mon cerveau qui stock les informations était un disque dur indexé de plusieurs Go.</description>

      <description>ENFINNNNN, depuis le temps que je me prends la tête avec cette connerie. Mon wiki était super lent sous Firefox et seulement sous Linux. J’avais trouvé la cause qui était le thème Monobook de Mediawiki. Mais pourquoi moi et pas les autres sites ?
C&amp;rsquo;est en fait à cause du CSS mis en place pour Monobook. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc changer ceci :
`/* Changer la couleur de fond des articles */&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; .</description>

      <description>Dans un environnement de prod, il peut être utilise de savoir ce que chaque personnes fait. Notament quand une boulette arrive et que personne ne se dénonce (hé oui, ça arrive). Les petits hackers en herbes (alias kéké) qui se disent hacker parcqu’ils ont foutu un keyloger sur une machine, ça peut les intéresser aussi. Parcontre, le but n’est évidement pas le même.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite documentation :</description>

      <description>Me voilà de retour avec un blog, qui je l’espère pourra être cette fois ci tenu à jour. J’ai eu quelques mésaventures par le passé, mais là, je suis bien bien bien décidé à le tenir à jour.
Donc pour les curieux, il y aura ici mes docs (enfin plutôt les liens vers mon wiki) informatiques, des photos rigolotes, des photos en live de mes vacances (merci l&amp;rsquo;iPhone et les nouvelles technos) ainsi que des infos sur ma vie.</description>
