I recently had a gift, this is a connected strap, the Jawbone UP24 model. It doesn't do a lot of things, but what it does works well.

I wanted one with a good autonomy. And a recent firmware update grew from 7 days to 14 the number of days the battery autonomy. I also wanted a strap able to give me information on night I've spent, doesn't let me sleep all the afternoon during a siesta. Those roles are perfectly fulfill with the Jawbone. It does more things like the snoozer which is nicer to have compared to a real one.

I was wondering if a connected watch wouldn't be better, but it's in fact not the same usage at all and the autonomy is not enough for the moment in my opinion.

To conclude, I'm happy about the UP24 :-)
