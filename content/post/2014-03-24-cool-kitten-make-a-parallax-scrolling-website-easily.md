If you want to easily build a static webpage with parallax effect, you can try the [Cool Kitten framework][1]. It is a young project that already have cool stuffs like grids solution, responsive design etc...It uses Normalize.css, jQuery Easing Plugin and Stellar.js.

You need nodejs to minify CSS but do not need nodejs server to run it, as it is static HTML pages.

In a few days, I'll show you my usage.
