Ubiquiti brings software that are easy to install on Windows and Mac OS. However as it is strongly recommended to let this software always up, it's preferable to have a Linux version to run it in a container or a virtual machine. That's why I decided to install it for a powerstrip mPower on Debian inside LXC.

The documentation is very poor, [that's why I made this one for those who want to do like me](https://wiki.deimos.fr/MFi:_install_a_Ubiquiti_server_to_manage_powerstrips). I hope you'll enjoy it
