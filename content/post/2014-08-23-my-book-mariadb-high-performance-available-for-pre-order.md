All, I'm proud to announce my first book available for pre-order! I'm really happy to have finished it and see after several months of hard work that it will be soon available.

Who is this book for?

> MariaDB High Performance is aimed at system administrators/architects or DBAs who want to learn more about how to grow their current infrastructure to support larger traffic.
> 
> Before beginning with this book, we expect you to be wellâ€“practised with MySQL/MariaDB for common usage. You will be able to get a grasp quickly if you are comfortable with learning and building large infrastructure for MariaDB using Linux.
