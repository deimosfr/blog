I tested some months ago [TinyTiny RSS](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Tiny_Tiny_RSS_:_Une_alternative_%C3%A0_Google_Reader) but it wasn't exactly what I expected from an RSS reader. That's why, when Google announced their Reader's end, I wanted to quickly find a reader that can fit my needs and have enough time to test it.

Fever answered most of them, instead of the mobile client. When I was on iPhone Reeder was nearly perfect, but not really Android with Meltdown.

I read Framasoft RSS solution based on TinyTiny RSS and I couldn't understood how users could switch from Google Reader to a Tiny Tiny RSS like (with what I saw during my tests). After a new try with the latest version, I discovered new interesting features and a really good Android client. So I switched to it :-)

I'm really happy with it now. [I've updated my documentation on it](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Tiny_Tiny_RSS_:_Une_alternative_%C3%A0_Google_Reader) for those who want to install it.
