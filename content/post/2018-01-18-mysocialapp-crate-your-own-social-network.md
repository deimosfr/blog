If you follow me, you may know that I launched with friends [Nousmotards][1] social application a few years ago. The solution continue to grow in France with more than 70k bikers and that's a good point for all those riders :)

Since we launched [Nousmotards][1], several persons asked us: "You've made an amazing job for bikers, do you provide your social solution to any other communities or for enterprises?". The answer was: No we didn't.

However since last year, we worked on providing a such solution. Now it's time to announce my new project: [MySocialApp][2].

Here are the key features:

* Get **your own iOS and Android application with your name and colors in 5 min**
* Send **push notifications** (geo-located or not) with your customers on mobile
* Customers usage statistics and real time content viewing
* Communicate with all your customers
* **Data belongs to you** (GDPR and e-Privacy ready)
* Easy **integration with your current tools** (CRM, ERP, Marketing automation, SMS etc...)
* No coding skills required, turnkey solution

Feel free to look at [MySocialApp website][2] and [our Indiehackers interview][3] for more explaination.

Now new challenges will start :)
