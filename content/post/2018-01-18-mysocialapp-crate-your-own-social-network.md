If you follow me, you may know that I launched with friends [Nousmotards][1] social application a few years ago. The solution continue to grow in France with more than 70k bikers and that's a good point for all those riders :)

Since we launched [Nousmotards][1], several persons asked us: "You've made an amazing job for bikers, do you provide your social solution to any other communities or for enterprises?". The answer was: No we didn't.

However since last year, we worked on providing a such solution. Now it's time to announce my new project: [MySocialApp][2].

**If you want your own social network, with your colors, your logo, with your own iOS and Android applications very quickly and published on the stores, don't search anymore !!! Start to use MySocialApp**

Feel free to look at [MySocialApp website][2] and [our Indiehackers interview][3] for more explaination.

Now new challenges will start :)
