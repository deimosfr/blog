A colleague talked to me about this tool this week and I felt in love. It helps to easily navigate into your git repository. You can have a look on last log and directly in the same interface the diff of the current commit. I've attached one screenshot to let you see how cool it is.

The are also a lot of other features but just for browsing purpose. You can't update or make changes. It's just simpler to browse. How to install it ? Simply:

{{< highlight bash >}}aptitude install tig{{< /highlight >}}

Test it you'll understand how nice it is :-)
