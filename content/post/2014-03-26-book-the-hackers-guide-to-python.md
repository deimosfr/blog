One of my colleague (Julien Danjou) wrote a book on advanced usage of Python. The book was out today and I strongly recommend buying it. Here is the summary of it:

> Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and more in many different industries. It is fast, flexible, and it comes with batteries included.
  
> Most of the books you read about Python will teach you the language basics – but once you've learnt them, you’re on your own in designing your application and discovering best practice.
  
> In this book, we'll see how you can leverage Python to efficiently tackle your problems and build great Python applications.
