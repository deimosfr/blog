[Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) is a cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool written in Python. 

It avoids to run several tools to get a all in one overview of your system. For example, when you want to quickly see what's wrong on a system for diagnosis, you'll need to launch top/htop, iostat, vmstat...Glances gives you a large overview of your system health.
  
You can then investigate with the appropriate tool if you want. But you didn't waste your time in opening several tools to get the first desired information : where does the problem comes from ? So Glances answer that question.

You can find [my documentation on Glances here](https://wiki.deimos.fr/Glances_:_all_in_one_monitoring_shell_tool).
