I finally found a tiling window manager for OS X and it's free ! It's called Xnomad and could be found on [GiHub](https://github.com/fjolnir/xnomad).

Easy to install, it gives the major features of a standard tiling window manager. This is a must have for me now on OS X.

Hope you'll like it as I !
