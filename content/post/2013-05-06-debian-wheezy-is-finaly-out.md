I'm so happy that [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) 7 is out :-) !

I've been running it since a few months on it (on my servers and as a desktop) and I congratulate Debian team for their work ! In the upcoming weeks I'll try to start getting involved in some Debian's packaging projects. My problem is : how many time do I have to give ?

One of my first taks, will be to integrate [MySecureShell](http://mysecureshell.sourceforge.net/) in the officials Debian repositories.

I'll let you know once it's done :-)
