I recently switched to iOS and there are unfortunately no really full featured application to support Tiny RSS. I tested several but didn't find anyone that fully answer my requests.

I remembered that there was a very good RSS reader on iOS called Reeder. Unfortunately it doesn't support any self hosted solution instead of Fever. I already used it [a few months ago](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/03/17/fever-lalternative-google-reader-que-jai-choisi/). But [I switched to TinyTiny RSS](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/07/05/bye-bye-fever-welcome-tinytiny-rss/) for several reasons and want to keep it.

Hopefully someone made a plugins to emulate Fever from Tiny Tiny RSS :-). [Here is the link](http://tt-rss.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1981).

It works pretty well, I can do offline read, staring sync etc...like what I used before on Android. Great isn't it ? :-)
