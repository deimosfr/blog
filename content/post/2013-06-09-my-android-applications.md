Since I'm an Android user, I try to find all apps that daily helps me. As I've spent several hours to test and configure them, I would like to share my experience with other peoples that want to switch from iOS like me.

First of all, you need advanced features if you are a poweruser. So get root privileges. Then install a mod like CyanogenMod. It will gives you more features to fine tune battery, CPU etc...

Then here comes the moment of applications :

  * Business Calendar : an iOS like Calendar with month view and extra features
  * K-@ Mail Pro : this is a client mail application with extra features like GPG
  * APG : manage my GPG key for emails signs and crypt
  * AirAudio : you can share any output audio through Airplay :-)
  * Anniversaires-free : choose advance birthday reminders
  * Caldav-sync and Carddav-sync : add carddav and caldav support with dual sync
  * JuiceSSH : a powerfull SSH client
  * LightManager : configure the LED color and speed notification
  * Movie Studio : a light iMovie like
  * My Manga Reader : an offline manga reader
  * Nova Launcher : speed up the launcher and add extra features. I really love that one
  * PlanCourses : a very good application to know what you have to buy
  * Qpdf viewer: a PDF application with annotations etc...
  * ROM manager : helps you to keep up to date some ROM/Mod
  * SSHServer : start an SSH serveron your android when you need it.
  * SuperSu : notify and configure when an application request root privileges
  * Business Tasks : easily takes your notes and sync them through you Google account
  * Titanium Backup : make your backups how and where you want
  * aNag : nagios notifier
  * AndFTP : FTP/SFTP client
  * TomTom Europe : I always loved TomTom :-)
