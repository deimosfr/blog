In my last post you've seen the [Ansible playbook I've made for ElasticSearch](https://galaxy.ansible.com/deimosfr/elasticsearch/). I've made a new one, but for Kibana which is able to easily manage version upgrade and of course is easy to install and use.

You can find [my Kibana playbook on GitHub](https://galaxy.ansible.com/deimosfr/kibana/).

The next once will of course be related to fluentd :-)
