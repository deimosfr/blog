For several years, I manually managed my MediaWiki instance manually and always upgraded manually, getting diffs, patching files etc... Now it's over, this method is simply not adapted to my needs.

Now, as MediaWiki use git, I decided to maintain my instance with the git repository and extensions as well. I've wrote a documentation on that :

  * [Installation method Core + extensions](https://wiki.deimos.fr/MediaWiki:Installation_et_configuration#Manual_Method)
  * [Upgrade core + extensions](https://wiki.deimos.fr/MediaWiki:Installation_et_configuration#Upgrade)

&nbsp;

I hope this will help some of you that still manage it by the old way.
