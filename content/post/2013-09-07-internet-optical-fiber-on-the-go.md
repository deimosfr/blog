Oh waaah, I'm so exited to get a real fast internet connection ! I've recently subscribed to Orange as they just add the fiber where I live. My bandwidth will be 300Mb/s instead of 9Mb/s today. The installation will occur in less than 15 days.

I unfortunately have to leave Free for this year and hope I'll could switch back to it in a year.

The bad news is I'll have a random public IP :-(. I'll will use Gandi API to change my IP on the fly.
