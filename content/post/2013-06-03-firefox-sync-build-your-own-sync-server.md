I'm very happy of Mozilla Sync service and trust more in Mozilla foundation than Google for my datas. Anyway there is a thing that I don't like : sharing my passwords into the cloud !

That's why I decided to create my own Sync Server. I want to thanks Mozilla for their work, it works like a charm :-). So now I don't use Mozilla server anymore, but my own. Here is [the documentation on how I did that](https://wiki.deimos.fr/Firefox_Sync_Server_:_create_your_own_Sync_Server).

I've based the installation on Debian Wheezy, Nginx and MariaDB.
