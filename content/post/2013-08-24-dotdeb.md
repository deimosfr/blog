I recently discovered that repository that looks correctly maintained and often updated.

I like this repository as it's updated faster than the Debian one and you can have the latest version of some packages. Of course you can do package pinning if you only want one or a set of packages.

You can access to the repository here : <http://www.dotdeb.org/>
