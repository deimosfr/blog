A few weeks ago, I played with [Synology Photo Station and AWS Glacier][1]. But it didn't convinced me a lot and I wanted to find a better alternative.

And here is the one I'm going to use called [Lychee](http://lychee.electerious.com/). It's a PHP based solution available on [GitHub](https://github.com/electerious/Lychee).

I really like that solution which doesn't have a lot of features, but enough to be used for personal usage and for family.

Thanks for that solution :-)

Note: If some of you are requesting a little documentation to install it on Debian, I'll do it.
