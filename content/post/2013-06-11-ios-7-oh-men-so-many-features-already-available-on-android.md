I'm so happy on Android now. That's right that graphic quality on standard iOS applications are better finished and ergonomic is better.

Anyway even with new interface and features on iOS 7, there are still remaining work in comparison of Android. And what about new Apple features ?... Not really relevant one :-(

I'll test it later on my iPad but I'm still frustrated even if it's better than the latests keynotes. Another last thing that I was interested in is the MacBook Air : No Retina display ! Why ? Every constructor give at least Full HD on their UltraBook 13 inch.

Conclusion : Apple, I still love you, but do not forget powerusers !

Update : I forgot th√© Mac Pro, this is a really good Apple innovation. But it's too much expensive for me :-(
