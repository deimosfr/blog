It's not really common, but here [is a tutorial I've made to analyze of a crash dump on Windows](https://wiki.deimos.fr/WinDbg:_analyze_crash_dump). I've only talked about how to setup the tools and how to use them but do not talk about the analyze itself. May be in another post if I have enough time.

Once again, I hope it could help some of you
