It's been a while since I was wondering if a Chromecast is really usefull. I bought one for a friend birthday because I knew that he would love.

After watching him playing with his new present, I was convinced to bought one for me. In fact what really convinced me is the last update which allows you, not only send specific apps to your screen, but all the screen to your TV. Then **you're able to see any app of your smartphone on your TV** and that works fine!

I then started to play with different kind of games, but it's **not mature enough**. It in fact **doesn't like speed**. So if it's a cards game or reflexion game, it's OK. However if you think you can play Modern Combat or car games on it, it's unfortunately not playable today.

I do not regret having bought one, it's easy to install and use, cheap and works well enough for my needs today.
