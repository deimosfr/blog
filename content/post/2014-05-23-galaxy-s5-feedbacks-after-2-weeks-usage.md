I recently changed my smartphone (yes once again) because I was very interested in Galaxy S5 features compared to Nexus 5:

  * Waterproof: better when you got child's and **can record video underwater**!
  *  _Better autonomy:_ I can have a **normal day without charging it**!
  *  _Better camera:_ once again when you have child's...The camera makes very **good photos** compared to Nexus 5.
  *  _Bigger screen:_ not a big point for me but it is better
  *  _Storage:_ can **add a micro SD card**. I have much more space now at a lowest price (compared to embedded storage)
  *  _Fingerprint:_ I thought that it would works as good as iPhone 5S. However, it's a **nightmare when you want to unlock from a single hand**. I do not understand why they implemented it if you need 2 hands to unlock.
  *  _Cyanogen:_ should be better compatible with Cyanogen as most of Galaxy (see previous article). However there is **no version at the moment** :-(

I really enjoyed the Nexus 5 but Galaxy S5 has really great features that interested me. Even if **fingerprint is not as good as expected** and if I have to wait for Cyanogen, I'm really happy to have changed.

The last thing I have to talk about is the ROM. Yes I'm waiting Cyanogen and hope it will be better running on Galaxy S5 than Nexus 5. However I couldn't wait Google ROM stock or Cyanogen as the Galaxy S5 natively comes with a bundle of extra applications that slow down your smartphone and consume more than 60% of the RAM. Of course Samsung brings very interesting features like ultra power saving mode. But I prefer being able to use resources for my needs instead of giving it to applications/features that I don't care/use (+90% of what Samsung brings). That's why I installed a Samsung based ROM with all Samsung apps removed (2 remains), that consume less memory and is more responsiveness called [XtreStoLite](http://www.phonandroid.com/forum/post1349933.html#p1349933).

New ROMs Cyanogen based have shortly been released for Galaxy S5 (g900f), however I prefer waiting a real cyanogen version instead. To get the complete list (in french) of the available ROMs, [follow the link](http://www.phonandroid.com/forum/roms-customs-sous-android-4-4-x-samsung-galaxy-s5-sm-g900f-t89821.html).
