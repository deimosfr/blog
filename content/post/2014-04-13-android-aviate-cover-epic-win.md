As you may read, I recently decided to drop Cyanogen :-(. Google Now interface is fine, but not enough user oriented for now days in my opinion. A few months ago, a friend ([@sebastien_han][1]) show me [Aviate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tul.aviate) and switched to it. This is an interface that helps you day to day to show you informations and apps you need depending on your localization. I really love it!

Last week I discovered [Cover](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coverscreen.cover ) which is a solution for the lockscreen. It helps to get fast app access depending on your localization too and depending on their usage. I really appreciate that app too.

Both app work vert well together! I strongly recommend to test them if you want to rediscover your phone :-)
