Cyanogen is finally available on Sumsung Galaxy S5 Europe (klte) :-). Thanks Cyanogen Team! For the moment, you can only grab nighly builds but everything is working fine on it.

Regarding the difference with the Samsung ROM, I noticed the battery life time is a little bit reduced (up to 15% depending on your usage). Camera is working fine, calls, screen etc... are ok too. I only have minor bugs that I don't really care in fact. Now I'm waiting the next first stable version :-)

You can get the [Cyanogen klte version here](http://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=klte&#038;type=).
