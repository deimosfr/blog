Yes I did it ! I finally switched from [my fantastic Lenovo](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/07/15/my-first-lenovo-t340-i-a-word-awesome/) to the latest MacBook Pro 13.

Some of you won't understand why I did it, but in fact you'll see this is an evidence. What was the problem with the Lenovo ? **Just the weight** ! I'm usually transporting it from work to home and vice versa. I now have a backache and it couldn't continue like that. Hopefully [eNovance](http://www.enovance.com) is a comprehensive company and allowed me to switch to another laptop of my choice.

So what were my requirements :

  * A lightweight laptop/ultrabook
  * A Full HD minimum screen size (to be able to see correctly my screen in any circumstance)
  * A long battery time
  * Triple screens (with a docking station or natively)

I first looked at Lenovo but no one fit all my requirements. Then I looked at the Dell XPS 13 developer edition, it was better but wasn't able to support triple screen (I definitively forgot to have USB video cards as I know how it's bad.
  
And then I looked at the MacBook Pro 13 and reminded that a keynote was approaching and decided to wait until the announcements.

The next day of the keynote, I decided to take a **MacBook Pro 13** because :

  * **Haswell** processor to reduce power consummation
  * **Long battery** time (up to **9h**)
  * **Only 1,57Kg** ! (Ultrabooks are around 1,3kg)
  * **Retina display** on 13 inches
  * **Triple screens** support

So now I'm on a Mac with Debian and Mac OS X in dual screens. Next post (in 2 days), I'll explain how I did to install Debian on it [in a next post](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/10/27/debian-on-the-last-macbook-pro-13/).
