On android, you may need some folder to no being indexed. It could be photos or videos...

To do so, use a [ES Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) for example and a '**.nomedia**' file inside the desired folder.

No index will be done in that folder. I like to do it when I temporary add TV series and don't want them to be indexed. By this way I don't see them in the Gallery application for example.
