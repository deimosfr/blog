Recently a new person as joined the administration of Dropbox called Condoleezza Rice. The problem is: this person is known to have allowed phone tapping in the US. So should be thrust in Dropbox anymore ?

For me not really. That's why I wanted to look at alternatives. I already tested [Owncloud](https://wiki.deimos.fr/OwnCloud_:_cr%C3%A9er_son_cloud_personnel) but was plenty of bugs. Also a [french post about that situation](http://linuxfr.org/news/quelles-alternatives-libres-a-dropbox) has been made.

I've looked at alternatives and [Seafile](http://seafile.com/) looks like the best alternative to Dropbox and Owncloud. I've just tested it and looks pretty good. I'm preparing a documentation to install and configure it in the next blog post (normally).
