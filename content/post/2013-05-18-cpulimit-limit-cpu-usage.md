In a sad scenario where an application is fully consuming CPU to limit it. To do so, you will need a magic command called Cpulimit that will help you to limit a PID to a desired percentage usage of your CPU.

I've wrote a little [documentation on cpulimit](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Cpulimit_:_limit_CPU_usage).
