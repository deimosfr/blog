This is my last month in Linagora. I enjoyed working with people as skilled as this, as friendly and I'll miss them. I There I discovered events like Meetups or FOSDEM and understood a lot of things regarding open sources communities.

Well, now my new job will start on 3rd of July. I'll keep you up to date when I'll start it and tell you where I'm going to work :-)
