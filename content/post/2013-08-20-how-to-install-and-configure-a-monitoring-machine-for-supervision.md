The goal of this documentation is how to quickly setup a monitoring screen machine for Nagios/Shinken. Several times in several company I had to do that kind of thing. On Mac OS and Linux.

I finished to create a documentation for the next times I'll have to deploy such things. The idea is to have a machine that nobody never touch once installed. It's always boring to plug a keyboard and a mouse when somethings goes wrong on this kind of machine that you normally never have to touch. That's why we'll see how to setup a minimal installation with all requirements to satisfy those needs. 

You can try with a Raspberry or any low consumption machine, it should work :-). [Here is the documentation](https://wiki.deimos.fr/How_to_install_and_configure_a_monitoring_machine_for_supervision).
