Next Wednesday, a meetup will take place in Paris talking about Elasticsearch. My previous post was talking about a log solution using Elasticsearch.

During that meetup, an overview of how Elasticsearch powerful real-time capabilities enrich Hadoop development. The session will showcase how to perform real-time searches on top and within Hadoop, Hive, Pig or Cascading jobs to get better answers, fast. 

We'll cover architectural topics such as index scalability, data locality and partitioning between the Hadoop cluster and the search index, using off and on-premise storages (HDFS, S3, local file-systems) and multi-tenancy. 

[Here are informations about the meetup](http://www.meetup.com/elasticsearchfr/events/173948772/), I'll be there :-)
