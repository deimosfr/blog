Like in most of programming languages, even if it's not a compiled one, there is always a solution to make binaries from your sources. To make is quick and easy I've wrote a little documentation on it. It's in french sorry, but you should be able to understand even if you don't speak french (or use the translate plugin in the left bar).

[Documentation is here](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Compiler_vos_scripts_PHP).
