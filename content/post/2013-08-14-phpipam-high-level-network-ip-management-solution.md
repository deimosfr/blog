Big warning about that tool ! I've never seen a such tool ! You can delete your old xls file or wiki pages related on IP informations. [phpipam](http://phpipam.net/) is simply awesome ! I've been waiting this tool so many years !

Here are some very interesting features :

  * Import IP addresses from XLS / CSV file
  * E-Mail notification with IP details
  * Subnet statistics
  * Displays free range and number of clients
  * A reservation process
  * A really nice look

If you want to try it, there is a demo site : [demo.phpipam.net](http://demo.phpipam.net/)
