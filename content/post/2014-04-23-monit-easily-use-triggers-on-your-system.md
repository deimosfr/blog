![Monit_logo](/images/logo_monit.png)
monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too much resources. You can use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes.

I've made a [little tutorial with my use case here](https://wiki.deimos.fr/Monit:_easily_use_triggers_on_your_system).

Hope this will help
