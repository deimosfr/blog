You may know that I'm one of the 2 founders of [MySecureShell](https://github.com/mysecureshell/mysecureshell). Around 6 years ago, we made a quick try to send MySecureShell to Debian and didn't make enough efforts to make it possible.

This time I worked hard [to make this happen](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mysecureshell). Thanks a lot to Gon√©ri Le bouder, a colleague and Debian dev to make it possible and helped me to do it fast, before Jessie freeze.

What's next? I'm going to prepare the integration in Ubuntu, EPEL and Mac OS X. I'm also working on an automated Python script to build packages with the help of Docker.

You will know when it will be done and you can follow the 'packaging' branch in the [Git repository][1].
