My last post was about existing alternatives to Dropbox. I also mentioned that I was trying Seafile.

I'm running now Seafile since a few days now and it works without any issues. The Linux and Android clients works very well. I just hope a sync feature in the Android version will appear. Regarding the web version, there are all attending collaboration features and that's great. Seafile supports file versioning and trash bin.

I would like to see external authentication for sharing content. I mean without creating a Seafile account, having the possibility to share files with a Google account for example. This will avoid to authenticate through Seafile and a dedicate account for each of your users.

I really like Seafile as it answers my needs. I've made [a documentation on how to setup it quickly on Nginx+SSL/MariaDB](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Seafile:_make_your_personal_storage_cloud_easily).
