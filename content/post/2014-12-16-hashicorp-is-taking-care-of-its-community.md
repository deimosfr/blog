I've been emailed for the first time less than 2 months ago by Kevin, a newcomer in HashiCorp which is taking care about marketing, community etc...

What I can say is I'm impressed by how they are taking care about their community :-). In my mailbox, I received a T-Shirt, 3 stickers and a letter.

Thanks a lot HashiCorp !
