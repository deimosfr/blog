I recently made a script at work to act as a service when a pattern is found (or not) on a website. You can also run pre and post script if you want.
  
It's a Windows binary that you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/deimosfr/url_service_action) or on my [Git](http://git.deimos.fr).

I did it in Perl. As described in the last post as I needed to have the interpreter embedded in the binary. I'm so bad to find good application name that I called it url\_service\_action. It's a shame right ? ðŸ˜‰
