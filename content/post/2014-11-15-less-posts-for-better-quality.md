Dear readers,

It's starting to be **harder and harder** **to write good articles every 2 days**. Some of you tell me that I should make less blog posts with better quality. However others tell me that they don't care about quality because they've learned something anyway.

I'm not going to make this choice by my own and **prefer let this to you**. That's why I'll be happy if you could answer to this poll:

Update: poll ended

I'll close the vote in a week.

Thanks a lot :-)
