Luc (@lstep) informed me about an interesting software that looks like [Juju](https://juju.ubuntu.com/) at first and I wanted to share it with you. It's called [Gaudi](http://gaudi.io/).

> If you already use [Docker](https://wiki.deimos.fr/Docker_:_manage_LXC_containers_easily_with_advanced_features) to setup your dev box for large applications, don't you suffer to maintain complex Dockerfiles?
> 
> Splitting a service Oriented Architecture into several Docker containers is the solution, except managing links and mounts between them is a pain. gaudi solves that by offering a way to describe a system of Docker containers using a simple DSL.
> 
> Describe your infrastructure in seconds, run gaudi, and all the containers are up, running and connected.

I didn't tested it yet, but really looks like interesting.
