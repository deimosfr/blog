And the thing has finally happened! <span id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps">In recent years,</span> <span class="hps">the idea of</span> <span class="hps">​​one day working</span> <span class="hps">at Red Hat</span> <span class="hps">pleases me</span>.</span>

As you may know, I'm working at eNovance and the news is: [RedHat has acquires eNovance!](http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2014/6/red-hat-to-acquire-enovance) So I belong now to Red Hat family :-). [RedHat really wants to to have our OpenStack experience](http://gigaom.com/2014/06/19/red-hat-is-busy-making-acquisitions-so-it-can-become-the-red-hat-of-the-cloud-with-openstack/) and I'm excited to work with other teams like Ceph (ex Inktank).

I really hope it will be an excellent adventure and will enjoy it.
