I recently played with ElasticSearch Cluster and I totally fall in love! How easy it is, everything is automatic, it works perfectly, wowwww!!!

I made a little [documentation on how to setup one, you can find it there](https://wiki.deimos.fr/ElasticSearch:_powerful_search_and_analytics_engine).

ElasticSearch is a really powerful solution and I really like working with it. If you're searching a full text search solution, try ElasticSearch, you'll be happy!
