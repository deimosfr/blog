I recently discover [Aptly][1] which permit to manage local Debian repositories. I waited this kind of tools during several years and now I'm really happy.

It is able to manage several repositories, making snapshots, merging snapshots, diff between 2 snapshots, filtering packages to avoid downloading unwanted ones....
  
This is perfect when you want to test before upgrading a critical infrastructure.
