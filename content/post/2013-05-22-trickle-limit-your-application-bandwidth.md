Once again, I would like to introduce a limitation software. This time, this is for network bandwidth. With trickle, you can limit upload and download of an application.

Good written application embed this kind of features, but if it's not the case it's easy to do so with Trickle. See [my documentation on Trickle](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Trickle_:_limit_your_application_bandwidth) to get more informations.
