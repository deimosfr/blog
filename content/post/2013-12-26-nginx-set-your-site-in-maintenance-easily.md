I recently needed to set a website in maintenance and wanted to do it as quickly as possible with any restart of Nginx.

The idea is to add a maintenance.html page at the root of your web folder and then the maintenance page is automatically taken into account.

To do it, simply [follow the link (in french)](https://wiki.deimos.fr/Nginx_:_Installation_et_configuration_d%27une_alternative_d%27Apache#Page_de_maintenance).
