Like me you may heard of Netflix for the first time a few months ago because of the announcement in Europe. However it's a massively used solution in the US since several years.

Today Netflix is out and **you can freely have a month to discover Netflix**. For the moment there are not a lot of films and series, but enough in my opinion to be an interesting solution. Of course because of the French laws, films are more than 3 years old and I hope this will change or I'm not sure it will be competitive enough. This is in my opinion outdated laws. More than that, **the price is cheaper than any other existing VOD solutions in France** (as far as I know).

This week, the CEO of Netflix told that **50% of new films/series will be added in the next 12 months**. Good news :-). I'm happy with the solution for the moment and I started with the free account and will keep it for several months (or more) I think.

What I'm really waiting now are:

  * Native Linux version in HTML5 (in progress)
  * An offline mode like Spotify (to watch movies or series in the subway for example, but didn't heard such things yet :-()

I really hope the last 2 points will come soon.
