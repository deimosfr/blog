The [SkySQL](http://www.skysql.com/) meeting was really good yesterday ! We've seen MariaDB 10 new features, had a presentation of [Galera cluster](https://wiki.deimos.fr/MariaDB_Galera_Cluster_:_la_r%C3%A9plication_multi_maitres) and a complicated (but good) explanation of a complex infrastructure that required write scaling.

This was the my first SkySQL Meet-Up and I can't wait until the next one :-). Congratulation SkySQL, one of the best Meet Up I've seen !
