You may remember the first introduction of [that tool here](http://blog.deimos.fr/2014/09/30/galera-innoptimizer-optimize-tables-without-stress/). I've made changes to support tables' partition, to avoid a big lock on huge tables.

The solution is to rebuild every partition one by one instead of rebuilding the whole table. This is smoother and less stressing Galera. I hope you'll enjoy [this new version (v0.2)](https://github.com/deimosfr/galera_innoptimizer).

Note: I still got issues on MariaDB 10 with such thing, I'm working on it.
