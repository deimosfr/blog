Big resolution with small screens is more and more common and we're facing a problem on fonts visualization as the readability is not optimal. We have a lot of non adapted fonts for retina display, even if most of them are not so bad. The solution to resolve that problem is to install additional fonts to replace the default one. And one of the best one I've seen is [Infinality][1] fonts !

I've changed my fonts to Infinality for a week now and I'm very happy with them ! If you look at the Mac fonts, how they are beautiful and always wondered how you could have the same on Linux, Infinality is the solution !

I've [made a documentation][2] to install them and you'll see how easy it is !
