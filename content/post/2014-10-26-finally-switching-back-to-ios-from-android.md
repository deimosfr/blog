In [previous posts](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/06/07/google-had-me-switching-from-ios-to-android/), I talked about why I switched from iOS to Android.

After 1 year and a half, after 3 different Android phones (Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S5), I'm finally going to switch back to iOS. For several reasons in facts but the major ones are those:

  * Application quality lower than on iOS
  * Lower global stability on Samsung Touchwizz and Cyanogen

I was pretty happy with Google Stock ROM, however it's not available on all devices and the Nexus do not have the better hardware (not talking about Nexus 6). And if you want a powerful hardware (like the S5) and Stock ROM, you do not have a lot of choices today and Cyanogen is the best alternative IMHO. But Cyanogen is not stable enough for the moment, I'm fed up to loose my time in searching the best compromise, reinstalling, restoring etc...

That's why I bought an iPhone 6 and waiting to receive it in a few days. I'll may switch to Android in several years but it's not mature enough in my opinion for my needs. I really would like that Smartphone Play Edition will appear more and more (and available in Europe) as I personally hate constructor's ROMs.
