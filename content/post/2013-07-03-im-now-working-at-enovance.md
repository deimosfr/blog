I'm glad and proud to start working at eNovance. Today is my first day and I've been hired as a technical leader.

I know there are some people here with a high technical level. I hope I'll learn high level stuff and help eNovance to grow up with all my years of experience.

I think that most of my future topics will be related to my favorites subjects as this is what I was searching for : automation, high availability, devops and bests practices in production.

Now a new adventure is starting for me and I hope I'll enjoy it.

PS: thanks Joffrey
