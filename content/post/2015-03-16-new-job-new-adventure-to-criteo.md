I spent nearly 2 years at eNovance/RedHat, it was a great adventure, now I'm glad to start a new job at [Criteo](http://www.criteo.com/fr/) today!

I'll be in charge of storage technologies around big data. My future blog posts will of course evolve to this kind of technologies too. However as I've side projects, there still will have several kind of subjects.

Really happy to start this new job :-)
