I red [that book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007836.do) a long time ago now and absolutely recommend that book !!!

This is a must have and read ! It helps you to have a good organization in your day to day life as a system administrator. In addition, it will gives you bests practices to accomplish some tasks and rules to stay focus on your work.

I repeat again : if you didn't read that book yet, do it now ! I already spoked and worked with people who red that book and we all agree that this is a must read and apply !

As soon as you apply those rules, you will gain time and be less stressed by any other disturbing things around you environments. Even if you can't apply all rules, I'm sure you can apply some of them and you've already applied some.
