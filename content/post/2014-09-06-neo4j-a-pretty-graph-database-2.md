I forgot to talk about 1 meetup I've been regarding Neo4j. A friend ([evomusic](https://twitter.com/evoxmusic)) talked to me about it and as I'm curious, I went to [this meetup in July](http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-france/events/189975922/). Neo4j is a highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph database. Neo4j is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading startups, enterprises, and governments around the world.

I you don't know what is a graph database, it's a very good introduction and will help you to understand what it is and how it works. Hopefully it has been recorded and [you can watch it here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzdNuky7hxPzX3BHOWNOUnpPYXc/edit). I really enjoyed the Meetup and hope a new one will come. You can find the slides of the Meetup here:

In addition of the fantastic database, there is an awesome browser! Just take a look at it and you'll understand:

I didn't had the chance to play with but I hope soon :-)
