I recently tested Photo Station on Synology because I was searching a solution to store my photos and accessible through internet with a web interface. I tested Photo Station and was not convinced by the solution as there are several bugs

  * Does not retain some default preferences
  * Forget to make some thumbnails when importing a lot of photos in several albums
  * etc...

I tested AWS backups and even if the price is correct, it's too slow for restoring in my opinion. Of course you shouldn't have to often restore, but it's boring to wait several hours for you backups to be available for restore.

To conclude, I drop the idea to use that solution :-( and will shortly propose an alternative.
