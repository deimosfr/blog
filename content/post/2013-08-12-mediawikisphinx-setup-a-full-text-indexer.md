You certainly know and have used the default MediaWiki search. It's quite good but it's not an optimal search. I wanted to have better one for my [wiki](http://wiki.deimos.fr) that's why I added Google search some years ago.

I didn't want to setup Apache Lucene or Apache Solar as both are in Java. I always heard good feedback about Sphinx, that's why I decided to add it at work and to my wiki as well. As it was the first time I used this kind of software, I was happy to find an already made configuration for MediaWiki with the extension.

As it takes some time to properly install on Debian, I've made an [how to install Sphinx for MediaWiki](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Sphinx_:_setup_a_full_text_indexer). I hope you'll enjoy it as I do with my wiki today.
