The 3.6 version of WordPress is out and finally bring a killer feature that I was waiting for more than 3 years now.
  
This feature is embedding videos without requesting additional extension and specific tags, it's a built-in HTML5 media player. It was already possible to add videos but they weren't playable directly on the page, it was a link.
  
As I manage the blog of my daughter, this is a really good news. Now I'm waiting h264 support from Firefox to remove ogv videos (as h264 is not compatible with Firefox on all plateforms yet).

There are also a some new features [available here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.6).
