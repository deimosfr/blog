For more than 10 years, I've seen IBM/Lenovo laptops and I really wanted one to try. Every users I met with this kind of laptop always told me that they are very happy with, are robust and got Linux supported drivers.

As I always wanted to get Mac instead of PC for my personnel usages, I never bought one. And as most of time, enterprises prefer cheap Dell than any other expensive robust laptop, I hadn'tÂ the chance to have a Lenovo till today.

I've never seen so many interesting features in a BIOS/EFI and a such high quality of fabrication than IBM/Lenovo on a PC family.

To finish, I would like to thanks eNovance for that PC. I'm sure I'll make a good job with it :-)
