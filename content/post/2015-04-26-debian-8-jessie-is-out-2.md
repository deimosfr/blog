Debian 8 is out ! After several months of freeze, it's now ready. I'm really happy about that version because [MySecureShell](https://mysecureshell.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is finally available in the mainstream packages and the second thing is [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) available in the latest stable version (10).

Unfortunately, Docker is not present because it has too fast cycles to be stable ([source](https://wiki.debian.org/Docker)). Thanks to Debian teams for this amazing work once again :-)
