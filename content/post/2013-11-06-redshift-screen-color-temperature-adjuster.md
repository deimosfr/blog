[Redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/) adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in front of the screen at night.

Two of my colleagues (Julien and Axel) praise virtues of this application. So I started to use it yesterday. For the moment, my opinion is good during the night, but during the day...I don't have opinion for the moment.

[Here is my configuration](http://git.deimos.fr/?p=git_deimosfr.git;a=blob;f=user_config/redshift/redshift.conf). Do not hesitate to test ( and reply to this post :-)
