I recently played with HAProxy and discovered that I've never made a documentation regarding this fantastic software. So if you don't know what HAProxy is, it's a load balancer working on layer 7 and specialized for http protocol.

It is able to handle sticky sessions which is really powerful. More than that, it has a small footprint and can work under a high load traffic.

[Here is my documentation](https://wiki.deimos.fr/HAProxy:_load_balance_your_traffic).
