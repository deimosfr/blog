A meetup on Ansible and SaltStack will take place in Paris next Monday. It unfortunately has not been initiated on the traditional meet up website and you may missed it like me.

So if you're interested by those two configuration tool outsiders, [follow the link](https://www.numaparis.com/Evenements/Python-pour-DevOps-Ansible-SaltStack). Both tools are written in Python, that why it is a Python meetup at first.

I'm happy to participate to the meetup as this is the first one, I'm sure I'll learn interesting things on it and meet new faces :-)
