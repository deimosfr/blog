![1601OS](/images/1601OS.jpg)
The day has finally come! After **several months of intensive work** (weekends and nights), I'm proud to announce that [my book on MariaDB High Performance is out][1]!

In that book, **I made my best to make things as simple as possible** to test features, test solutions and to explain everything in the simplest way. Of course if you're a beginner on MariaDB (and Linux), it may be hard. But if you're familiar with basics and want to go further with performances and high availability on MariaDB, **you'll enjoy it**.

I really would like to **thanks PackT once again for proposing me to write that book and thanks reviewers** (Joffrey Michaie, Dimitri Savineau, Daniel Parnell, P.R. Karthik, Emilien Kenler and David Chanial (DaviXX)) for that. To finish I have to **thanks a lot my wife and my daughter** for giving me the time to do it.

I hope you'll enjoy reading that book. So not hesitate to tell me what do you think about it and what you would like to see in that book as well. I think I'll make a second version in a few years, but for the moment I'll take time with my family :-)

Good reads :-)
