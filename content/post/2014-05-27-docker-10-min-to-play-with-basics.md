I've heard of Docker a year ago, started to play with it for some months and really start using it a few days ago. At first, I thought it was more complex than expected and finally I saw how simple it is and how many time I've lost because I didn't used it.

Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere. Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on and between virtually any server. The same container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production, on VMs, bare-metal servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.

Common use cases for Docker include:

  * Automating the packaging and deployment of applications
  * Creation of lightweight, private PAAS environments
  * Automated testing and continuous integration/deployment
  * Deploying and scaling web apps, databases and backend services

If you're thinking the interest is not really huge compared to a VM, please try it. This is absolutely not the way you should see it in fact.

You may want a quick install and use to avoid wasting your time, that's why [I've wrote a documentation to set it up in less than 10 min](http://wiki.deimos.fr/Docker_:_manage_LXC_containers_easily_with_advanced_features). This is the first step of that documentation, I will add use cases in the next weeks and will make a new blog post on it. Now try it fast and see the potential.

I hope I've converted you to docker :-)
