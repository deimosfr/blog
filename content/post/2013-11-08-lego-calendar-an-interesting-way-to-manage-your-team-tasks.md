[The lego calendar](http://vitaminsdesign.com/projects/lego-calendar/) is a wall mounted time planner that we invented for our studio. It’s made entirely of lego, but if you take a photo of it with a smartphone all of the events and timings will be magically synchronised to an online, digital calendar. It makes the most of the tangibility of physical objects, and the ubiquity of digital platforms, and it’s also puts a smile on our faces when we use it!

I've found this project very interesting and wanted to share it with you.
