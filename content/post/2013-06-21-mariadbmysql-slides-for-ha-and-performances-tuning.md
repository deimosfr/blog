I recently gave a training on MariaDB/MySQL regarding performances tuning and High Availability. You can find here the slides I've made for it (french).

Some subjects related in that document are replication master -> slave, master < -> master and Galera Cluster. You can [download the PDF here](http://wiki.deimos.fr/images/5/5c/Mariadb_mysql_avance.pdf) or see it directly on SlideShare : 

I hope this will help some of you to get a better understanding on some advanced features.
