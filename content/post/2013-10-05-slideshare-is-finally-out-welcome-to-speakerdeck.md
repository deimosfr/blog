[Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/) is the best way to share presentations online. Simply upload your slides as a PDF, and they will turn them into a beautiful online experience. View them on SpeakerDeck.com, or share them on any website with an embed code. More than that, **it produces HTML 5 slides and there are no Ads** :-)

I'm fed up about slideshare which doesn't grow as it should be. They still produce flash slides and as many people, I don't want it anymore. **SlideDeck is made by GitHub** Inc and that's a good point. I started to move my slides from slideshare to SpeakerDeck but will still keep them on slideshare as this is the reference today.

You can [find my slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/deimosfr).
