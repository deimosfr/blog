I recently bought a new keyboard. This is the [Enermax Caesar](http://www.enermax.fr/fr/caesar-:-un-nouveau-clavier-signe-enermax-!/105-2-a.html). My [boss](https://twitter.com/wbonnet) talked to me about it, as he bought the same.

For several months, I thinked to change my current one, but none really exited me. But this one is really, really cool. The touch feeling is really fine, additional button are nice (more would be great as well...but it's ok) and the must : input and output sound are directly on the keyboard, without any additional cables (all through USB :-)).

The keyboard borders are cold, looks like honeycomb and the weight is high (1,6 Kg). What is a little bit missing : the keys backlight. Anyway, it's the best keyboard of all my life for the moment. Thanks [William](https://twitter.com/wbonnet) :-)
