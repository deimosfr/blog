Yes once again and for a long time now I think, I moved to i3. It does not make so many thing than Awesome, however working on multiple screen with it, it's better.

That's why I wanted to make a new test with it and it's now adopted. I spent a little bit time on reconfiguring all my needs (workspaces depending my screen configuration, opening app on a defined workspace, keyboard bindings etc...).

It's almost done now and I can share [my configuration with you](http://git.deimos.fr/?p=git_deimosfr.git;a=tree;f=user_config/i3;h=57e0b9f78dc20a808361d3e5b464ebe5fc87be64;hb=HEAD). You will also need to look at my [xinitrc][1] configuration as I generate it at each boot of my desktop.

If you did not tested i3 yet, make a try!
