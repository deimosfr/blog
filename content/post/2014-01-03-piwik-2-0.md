[Piwik 2.0](http://piwik.org/) has been released a few days ago. The upgrade of my version was done without any issues (as a rule with Piwik).

I like the look of this new version and like the new mobile application on Android. It's really better organized and really looks like as an application (compared with the first version).

There are some new interesting features for professionals (not for my personal usage).

If you don't know it yet, it's a good alternative to Google Analytics and you should try it.

Good statistics
