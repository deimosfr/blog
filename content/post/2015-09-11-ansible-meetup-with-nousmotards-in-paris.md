A long long time since my last blog post ! I didn't had the time to make one because of the time I spent on building Nousmotards infrastructure.

If you're interested in how I built the infrastructure, come and see us on the [Ansible Meetup next Tuesday](http://www.meetup.com/fr/Ansible-Paris/events/223572292/) ðŸ˜‰ The slides and video of the Meetup will be made and available on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/fr/).

If you're a French biker, do not hesitate anymore! Use [Nousmotards](https://www.nousmotards.com/) for now, you'll be happy to see how it's easy to spend good times and meet nice peoples!
