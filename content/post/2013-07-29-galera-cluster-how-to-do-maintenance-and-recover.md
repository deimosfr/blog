To finish my Galera's posts, [I've wrote tips to help on maintenance and recover for the Galera Cluster](https://wiki.deimos.fr/MariaDB_Galera_Cluster_:_la_r%C3%A9plication_multi_maitres#R.C3.A9cup.C3.A9ration_et_maintenance) (in french). As most of the time, Galera is able to manage automatically data recovering, some times (if split brain occurs for example) you need to manually do specific stuffs to recover the cluster.

I hope this will help some of you if problems occurs.
