Some of you may already know that I've been contacted by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) to write a book.
  
As every aware persons asked me why I was contacted, here is the story :

When I was working for Linagora, I gave a training on advanced usage on MySQL/MariaDB. Unfortunately there weren't slides on that subject at this moment and I had to make them all. That's what I did and made an unbranded version for me as well. As I'm a community person and have the Open Source spirit, I shared those slides on [Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/deimosfr/mariadb-mysql-avance) and [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/deimosfr/mariadb-mysql-avanc). Packt wanted to have a book on advanced usages and architectures for high load traffic on MariaDB and they found my slides. Then they saw [my resume](http://cv.mavro.fr) and finally contacted me.

As this is my first book and didn't realize all the time it will consume. So I spoke to one of my colleague [Frédéric Lepied](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Lepied) ([eNovance](http://www.enovance.com/)) who already wrote some book to get feedbacks. I finally started the adventure.

On that book, I work alone but I have the chance to have excellent reviewers who are [Dimitri Savineau](https://github.com/dsavineau) ([eNovance](http://www.enovance.com/)) and [Joffrey Michaie](https://twitter.com/db_cat) ([SkySQL](http://www.skysql.com/)).

I've started to write it a the end of the last year and it will be ready nearly September. I'll give you more informations on it in the next months.
