Hi all,

This time, I'm asking help to find a good load testing tool. The one I know is [Tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/) but it's not able to speak to some social API. I would like to know what kind of solution you are using and your feedback on it. I already played with [Jmeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/) and I do not remind that it's able to do better.

Any help is appreciated :-)

Thanks
