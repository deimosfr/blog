I'm using Slim for a few months and I'm very happy with it. It's simple, do what does it have to do and it's light. But I wanted to customize it to give a look similar to my [Awesome theme](http://blog.deimos.fr/2013/04/10/awesome-powerlined/).

That's why I've took Gimp and [modified a theme I liked](http://bigrza.deviantart.com/art/Slim-Hud-Theme-265373570). You can see the result :-)

You can [find my configuration here](https://git.deimos.fr/?p=git_deimosfr.git;a=tree;f=user_config/slim) and modify it if you want :-)
