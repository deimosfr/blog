It's not common for me to speak about a game, but once again, the new GTA is Amazing and I needed to do a post on it.

It's impressive how the beauty of the game is ! In addition the map is awesome : sea, buildings, streets...and the liberty that you have is unbelievable. This is once again a must have !

Thanks again to Rockstar for it :-)
