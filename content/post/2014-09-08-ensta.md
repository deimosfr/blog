Next week I'm going to teach basics computer science to future Engineers on Linux/HTML/CSS at [ENSTA (Ecole Nationale des Techniques Avanc√©es)](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr/).
  
This is the first time I will teach to students so I hope it will as interesting as for professionals (or more) :-).

I will teach during 1 week so blog posts may slow down a little bit. Now I'm crossing fingers for this week :-p

Thanks Marc fort this experience :-)
