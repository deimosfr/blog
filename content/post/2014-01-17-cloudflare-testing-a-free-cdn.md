[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is a Free solution to load your website faster and add security. I've tested it 2 days ago, that's why you may experienced issues in accessing the blog and wiki.

I had issues on WordPress, so I need to correct some problems relating images (http/https) as the Free version of CloudFlare doesn't support SSL. That's why I've roll back for the moment.

I have other kind of modifications to make on WordPress before it works as it should. Anyway, my colleague Sebastien Han has [his blog](http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/) loading very fast as you can see (not on wordpress) and the [Korben's blog](http://korben.info/) which loads fast on WordPress.

CloudFlare provides an API as well which makes a powerful and free solution :-)

If you try it on your WordPress, please let me know what kind of problem you encounter as well.
