      <description>Neo4J is the most popular graph database in the NoSQL databases family. We&amp;rsquo;re using it in the Nousmotards project to store all social data through nodes and relationships.
Today I am going to talk about our experience after having using it for 2 years now (take a look at directed graph if you are not really familiar with Graph Database).
1/ Our use case Nousmotards is a social network for bikers, we aim to provide valuable tools to ride, meet and share nice time with people who like motorcycling.</description>

      <description>The Ansible meetup ended ! That was really nice for my first one.
I had really great feedbacks and liked the questions when ended. More than that I met nice people after the meetup and could have interresting discussions :-). I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about it.
For those who would like to review the slides, you can find them here:

      <title>Ansible: Neo4j role available on Ansible Galaxy</title>

      <description>For a new project (will talk about it later), I needed to use Neo4J (graph database if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet).
I tried to cover more features than the current existing Ansible roles available on Ansible Galaxy. More will come in the next weeks. I also tried to make it simple to install it and do not force dependencies at maximum. Here are parameters you can set:
# Select neo4j version neo4j_package: neo4j # community version #neo4j_package: neo4j-advanced #neo4j_package: neo4j-enterprise # Neo4j spatial plugin neo4j_install_spatial: false neo4j_spatial_version: &amp;#39;0.</description>

      <description>I recently played with ElasticSearch Cluster and I totally fall in love! How easy it is, everything is automatic, it works perfectly, wowwww!!!
I made a little documentation on how to setup one, you can find it there.
ElasticSearch is a really powerful solution and I really like working with it. If you&amp;rsquo;re searching a full text search solution, try ElasticSearch, you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!</description>

      <title>Deploy a logs management infrastructure (Elasticsearch&#43;Kibana&#43;Fluentd) with Ansible</title>

      <description>During the last weeks I started to play with Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana. I made a documentation to help on deploying it easily.
As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m an Ansible fan, so I made Ansible playbooks to deploy a complete infrastructure (server and clients). They will deploy this kind of architecture:
On the client side, Fluentd clients will get syslog and Nginx logs, to send them to the Fluentd server. On the server side, a Fluentd receiver will be there to get data from other Fluentd clients.</description>
