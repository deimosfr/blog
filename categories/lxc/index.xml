      <description>The Ansible meetup ended ! That was really nice for my first one.
I had really great feedbacks and liked the questions when ended. More than that I met nice people after the meetup and could have interresting discussions :-). I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about it.

      <description>You may know that I really like LXC and the major problem when you want to use that solution in production is: how do you monitor memory and CPU?
Regarding the CPU side, I do not have an easy answer for the moment :-(. However regarding the memory, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Nagios/Naemon check which will check the memory (RAM) and SWAP of a container. Here is how to use it:</description>

      <title>LXC 1.0 on Debian Wheezy</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using for my own servers LXC for about a year now. I&amp;rsquo;m still fed up about bugs introduced by the beta version of LXC (0.8b) present in Debian Wheezy. As now LXC project has released a stable version, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at the Debian backports, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have any chance to find a newer version on it :-(. However, a version 1.0.4 exist on Debian Jessie. I took the Debian sources and recompiled them on Wheezy (available here).</description>

      <title>LXC: ressources statistics</title>

      <description>I wanted to find a way to properly view resources (memory/CPU/IO) usages or configuration. For that I need to use cgroups. But the problem are on free, top, htop or common any tools, as they do not get the real informations of the container.
We&amp;rsquo;re in fact waiting on a lot of work on the kernel side or systemd side. More information&amp;rsquo;s can be found here. Another solution that permit to bind a socks inside containers exists called CGManager, however classical tools doesn&amp;rsquo;t use it to get informations.</description>

      <description>I recently migrated this server to a new one. New hardware, better performance, less power consumption etc&amp;hellip;Thanks Online.
I&amp;rsquo;m already using LXC on my home server and see the benefits for 8 months ago. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to migrate this server to LXC as well. The difference here is that I wanted to migrate my VM from KVM. All my KVM VM are on Debian Wheezy so that was pretty easy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently updated my LXC role for ansible. You can get it like that:
ansible-galaxy install deimosfr.lxc  Here is the change log:
+ Adding new parameters for dnsmasq and interfaces + Adding new prequesite to avoid unwanted modules to load in the latest kernel versions = Corrected networking configuration issue = Templates do not create @LOCALSTATEDIR@ folder anymore  It works perfectly on my new Dedibox :-)</description>

      <title>Docker: only 10 min to play with basics</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Docker a year ago, started to play with it for some months and really start using it a few days ago. At first, I thought it was more complex than expected and finally I saw how simple it is and how many time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost because I didn&amp;rsquo;t used it.
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally finished my documentation on LXC for Debian Wheezy. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve added the most interesting features.
I&amp;rsquo;m now going to migrate my servers from KVM to LXC as I only POC it for now. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you up to date when everything will be migrated.</description>

      <description>As you can see, I write more and more posts on LXC. The latest thing I worked on, was how to convert a host/vm to a LXC container. I needed to write a script for it as I didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I needed.
The script will remove unneeded elements in a Debian system, removing folders (dev,proc,sys), recreate devices and configure etc files. You can find more informations by following the link.</description>

      <title>LXC : Some little setbacks</title>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m new to LXC, I am discovering how it works, see the maturity of the project and it&amp;rsquo;s integration in Debian. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a post a few weeks ago to introduce the basics and now I&amp;rsquo;m digging in advanced features.
I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered several issues. Most of them are not critical but unfortunately looks like a lack of integration on Debian.
 The first one is related to wheezy template and I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it in a previous post.</description>
