      <title>Deploy CoreOS with Ansible</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
CoreOS is a lightweight Linux operating system designed for clustered deployments providing automation, security, and scalability for your most critical applications.&amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with CoreOS to replace Debian hosts which run Docker containers on Nousmotards project. CoreOS helps on simplifying bare metal deployment and avoid managing OS upgrade.
As I&amp;rsquo;m still an Ansible lover, I&amp;rsquo;ve made 2 roles:
 CoreOS Ansible:&amp;nbsp;Ansible role to deploy pypy to CoreOS to be able to get Ansible prerequisites CoreOS: Ansible CoreOS role to deploy CoreOS on bare metal servers  The first one is&amp;nbsp;for installing pypy to run Ansible and the other one to bootstrap CoreOS with Cloudinit or/and Igninition.</description>

      <description>Long time since my last post. This one is not very technical post, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice to have solution if you use grep usually. Are not you fed up to type vim  and search the line after a grep command ? If yes, this post is for you.
First of all, you may know that an alternative more user friendly to grep exist, called ag (perf comparison). I really like ag and grep, but something make me loose my time since several years and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s your case too.</description>

      <title>Zero downtime upgrade with Ansible and HAProxy</title>

      <description>Some of you may not be familiar with the terms &amp;ldquo;Rolling upgrade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Rolling restart&amp;rdquo;. This is the action of upgrading or restarting a cluster without service interruption (alias zero downtime). In most cases, this is done node by node, but in fact it depends of the technology you&amp;rsquo;re managing and the number of active nodes in your cluster.
At Nousmotards we have several Java Spring Boot applications running. Restarting one application can take up to 1 min.</description>

      <description>This title can sounds like a troll, but this is not the case! I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as a feedback. When I spoke during an Ansible meetup presenting Nousmotards infrastructure, I had several questions regarding why I chose monit as the init system instead of supervisord. That&amp;rsquo;s what encouraged me to write this post and that&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to clarify here the things.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Graphite at work and for my Nousmotards project. For Nousmotards, I&amp;rsquo;m using the Graphite version available in the default Debian Jessie repositories. This to avoid mismatch django dependencies etc&amp;hellip;
A few days ago, I wanted to try Graphite events to get something pretty cool in Grafana :
This to be able to know when a new app version is deployed and make it easier to understand when an issue occurs.</description>

      <description>Hi all ! Long time since last blog post ! I&amp;rsquo;m using Jenkins with Ansible on my Nousmotards project for building docker containers or deploying into production.
You may noticed that you&amp;rsquo;ve no Ansible color when running it into Jenkins! The simple way to correct it is to export an environment variable in your Jenkins job:
export ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true  Now that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool! However, you may also noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s some kind of lags on the console when you want to see a real time console log on Jenkins.</description>

      <description>As I wanted to upgrade it and because it has been asked several time, I upgraded the consul-template Ansible role to manage official binaries (and upgrades). Here are the new vars:
consul_template_version: &amp;#39;0.11.0&amp;#39; consul_template_arch: &amp;#39;linux_amd64&amp;#39; consul_template_http_src: &amp;quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/releases/download/v{{consul_template_version}}/consul_template_{{consul_template_version}}_{{consul_template_arch}}.zip&amp;quot;  You can of course find the role to Ansible Galaxy: https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/role/3451
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this new version :-)</description>

      <description>The Ansible meetup ended ! That was really nice for my first one.
I had really great feedbacks and liked the questions when ended. More than that I met nice people after the meetup and could have interresting discussions :-). I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about it.

      <description>A long long time since my last blog post ! I didn&amp;rsquo;t had the time to make one because of the time I spent on building Nousmotards infrastructure.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how I built the infrastructure, come and see us on the Ansible Meetup next Tuesday 😉 The slides and video of the Meetup will be made and available on InfoQ.

      <description>I recently had the chance to get the latest MacBookPro 13 for my new work at Criteo. If you follow me and remember, this is not the first time I want to use Debian on a new MacBookPro version.
Overview History repeats itself and as you can think, some things are not working out of the box on Debian Jessie. Here are the issues I encountered and how i could fix some of them:</description>

      <description>Debian 8 is out ! After several months of freeze, it&amp;rsquo;s now ready. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about that version because MySecureShell is finally available in the mainstream packages and the second thing is MariaDB available in the latest stable version (10).
Unfortunately, Docker is not present because it has too fast cycles to be stable (source). Thanks to Debian teams for this amazing work once again :-)</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll be in charge of storage technologies around big data. My future blog posts will of course evolve to this kind of technologies too. However as I&amp;rsquo;ve side projects, there still will have several kind of subjects.
Really happy to start this new job :-)</description>

      <description>For a new project (will talk about it later), I needed to use Neo4J (graph database if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet).
I tried to cover more features than the current existing Ansible roles available on Ansible Galaxy. More will come in the next weeks. I also tried to make it simple to install it and do not force dependencies at maximum. Here are parameters you can set:
# Select neo4j version neo4j_package: neo4j # community version #neo4j_package: neo4j-advanced #neo4j_package: neo4j-enterprise # Neo4j spatial plugin neo4j_install_spatial: false neo4j_spatial_version: &amp;#39;0.</description>

So I decided to upgrade my 2 personal servers to Jessie. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so easy with Systemd. I still encounter non critical issues and going to prepare report bugs for Debian (cgroups issues with systemd).</description>

      <description>For another personal project (that I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about for the moment ;-)), I wanted to have a Changelog file to get a better following of the infrastructure evolution (configuration management, scripts&amp;hellip;all under git). Of course the documentation is very important, but when you do not write it at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re building the infrastructure, it may be complex to remember each little things you&amp;rsquo;ve done. That&amp;rsquo;s why a Changelog can help to understand how the infrastructure has been built step by step.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I wanted to play with HAProxy SSL offloading. It was a good experience and alternative to Nginx SSL offloading (I already talked about in this blog). But this is not the topic here&amp;hellip;
When I was trying to make the offload working on the blog, I modified WordPress options which switched my blog into an infinite loop mode. As it was late and I was tired (bad idea), I just wanted to rollback my changes and needed to recover a SQL backup to do it fast.</description>

The good On HAProxy, the good thing is the simplicity to do it. First of all you need to have at least the version 1.5 of HAProxy so to get SSL support. Then you only need those lines to offload SSL:</description>

      <description>Packer is a really great solution to make an image in several formats (VirtualBox, Docker&amp;hellip;). I recently wanted to deploy it on a Jenkins server to automatically perform image build with the help of Packer.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a Packer role for Ansible really easy to use. You simply have to set (or let them by defaults) vars:
# Packer version to install packer_version: &amp;#39;0.7.5&amp;#39; # Packer destination folder packer_destination: &amp;#39;/usr/bin&amp;#39;  It will install the desired version :-)</description>

      <description>For my company, I recently had to find a good solution to make Snapshots from Instance IDs or from tags on AWS. I made several searches but unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I was searching for.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to make a tool to do this kind of job. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python and requires the Boto library. Here is what you can do with Simple EC2 snapshots:
 Hot snapshots (by default) and Cold snapshots   Multiple instances snapshot in one line   Detection of doubles   Filters by tags (allowing wildcards) or by instance IDs   Credentials file multiple with profiles   Limit the number of snapshots   Restrict snapshots to data disks only   The tool is open source and can be downloaded on GitHub :-).</description>

      <description>Packer is one of the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used in the past to build VirtualBox boxes. You can find what I&amp;rsquo;ve done on my GitHub account.
For Smash project, I wanted to make a packer configuration to manage Docker and VirtualBox. I also wanted to call Ansible to build specific images for each needs. The goal is to be able to build cloud image ready to start, without any special dependencies. This because I need different usages:</description>

      <description>In the last post, I talked about how to manage Docker and VirtualBox with Vagrant. This post follows the last one, with the integration of Ansible as a provisioner. Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m using it for the Smash project.
With Ansible, I made several &amp;ldquo;group_vars&amp;rdquo; files containing custom and common information related to the used environment (dev, uat, staging&amp;hellip;). This helps to setup different kind of environment easily. Vagrant will help to build images with Ansible deployed inside.</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m using Vagrant for more than a year now with VirtualBox. Docker is a faster alternative that needs to be taken into consideration. Having the possibility to manage both of them with the same tool can be very interesting. For information, I mainly use it with VirtualBox because it&amp;rsquo;s any platform compatible and Docker because it&amp;rsquo;s perfect for a CI like Jenkins.
I recently talked about my implication into the Smash project.</description>

      <description>About 2 months ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve been contacted to join an a team of 5 persons, on making (once again) a solution to find love. So many solutions already exists today, but this one is a little bit different in my opinion, that&amp;rsquo;s why I accepted to take part of the adventure.
This solution is interesting because you&amp;rsquo;re anonymous. This can help you a lot if you&amp;rsquo;re shy. This kind of Phone application would help me a lot in the past if it was existing !</description>

      <description>For my personal usages, I wanted do use DotDeb and MySQL playbooks. I first looked at the current ones on the Ansible Galaxy. However I did not find a good one for my needs.
I first wanted to try to contribute to an existing one. But I needed to have them quickly and unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to do it.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I made 2 new Ansible roles and added them to Ansible Galaxy.</description>

      <description>If like me, you were using the Ansible Galaxy website to find and download your playbook for your favorite apps, you may missed a feature.
It happened to me when I had to manage several playbook roles. I first wanted to use Git submodules to do it. However I preferred to search another way to do like like Puppet can do with R10K because I am working on a project with some unfamiliar Git users.</description>

What I can say is I&amp;rsquo;m impressed by how they are taking care about their community :-). In my mailbox, I received a T-Shirt, 3 stickers and a letter.
Thanks a lot HashiCorp !</description>

      <description>Following the deployment blog post I made on ES/Kibana/Fluentd, I released new version of Fluentd and Kibana playbooks to support the latests versions of themselves and ElasticSearch.
ElasticSearch 1.4 version is ,out which doesn&amp;rsquo;t changed anything for the deployment. However Kibana requires to enable an ElasticSearch configuration option now, to work properly. I updated the Kibana playbook for it.
On its side, Fluentd has the major release 2.0 out and I updated Ansible playbook for the best integration with Debian Wheezy.</description>

      <description>A lot of time, I had to modify the text of my commit since I&amp;rsquo;m using a versionning system. Modifying the last commit comment is something common:
git commit --amend  However, modifying the date is not so common. You may want to do it for several reasons (stats or similar), here is how to:
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=&amp;quot;`date`&amp;quot; git commit --amend --date &amp;quot;`date`&amp;quot;  This will change the last commit with the current date.</description>

And when I tried to remount NFS clients connexions, I got:

      <description>Thanks for all voters. I expected more participants (compared to the number of followers) but it gives me here a good indication on what you want me to focus on.
You may already seen that this week I made less blog posts as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any quite big subjects to talk about or time to prepare.
Thanks to follow me, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make better posts new but a little bit less.</description>

      <description>First of all I will only talk about open sources solutions. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take part of any commercial one. In addition, I will focus on only 4 solutions which seem to me the most used at this time. I will also talk about my history, my level on each one and why I recommend or not that solution.
Puppet is in my opinion the most known solution. Because of the marketing they were/are doing, because it was a good alternative compared to the old cfengine.</description>

      <description>Dear readers,
It&amp;rsquo;s starting to be harder and harder to write good articles every 2 days. Some of you tell me that I should make less blog posts with better quality. However others tell me that they don&amp;rsquo;t care about quality because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned something anyway.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make this choice by my own and prefer let this to you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy if you could answer to this poll:</description>

      <description>I recently saw a blog post (don&amp;rsquo;t remember the link :-() on something I used several times but never made an article on. So this time, I&amp;rsquo;m making a blog post on it as this is solution is very useful.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you already had to tcpdump on a remote server to investigate. When you have a lot of traffic, it can start to be painful to add a lot filter, having no colors, reading tcpdump row format etc&amp;hellip; And most of the time Wireshark can help on having a better visibility on what happens.</description>

      <description>I recently switched to iOS and there are unfortunately no really full featured application to support Tiny RSS. I tested several but didn&amp;rsquo;t find anyone that fully answer my requests.
I remembered that there was a very good RSS reader on iOS called Reeder. Unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support any self hosted solution instead of Fever. I already used it a few months ago. But I switched to TinyTiny RSS for several reasons and want to keep it.</description>

  fixes for severity: important bugs in packages of priority: optional or extra, only when this can be done via unstable (until the 5th of December 2014);</description>

And here is the one I&amp;rsquo;m going to use called Lychee. It&amp;rsquo;s a PHP based solution available on GitHub.
I really like that solution which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of features, but enough to be used for personal usage and for family.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing a complete packaging stack based on Docker to easily make different kind of packages for several Linux distributions. This for MySecureShell project.
This stack will be used to build packages in destination of upstream Linux distribution packages. But I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a simpler and faster way to create custom repositories mainly for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Fedora. In addition if packages could be automatically created when a new tag is pushed to the GitHub account, it would be perfect.</description>

This time I worked hard to make this happen. Thanks a lot to Gonéri Le bouder, a colleague and Debian dev to make it possible and helped me to do it fast, before Jessie freeze.</description>

      <description>In previous posts, I talked about why I switched from iOS to Android.
After 1 year and a half, after 3 different Android phones (Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S5), I&amp;rsquo;m finally going to switch back to iOS. For several reasons in facts but the major ones are those:
 Application quality lower than on iOS Lower global stability on Samsung Touchwizz and Cyanogen  I was pretty happy with Google Stock ROM, however it&amp;rsquo;s not available on all devices and the Nexus do not have the better hardware (not talking about Nexus 6).</description>

      <description>Merging from one branch to another branch is something common with Git. I had to do it several times and recently I had to make a big one. I&amp;rsquo;ve just never took the time to look at what exist to make faster merge and how to use it.
After some researches, I found git mergetool which will use VIM (by default on my laptop) to have a better view on what I have to do, to merge my files.</description>

      <description>You may upgrade your Mac OS X version to Yosemite (10.10) and saw you dual boot with Linux not working anymore :-(.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Apple made changes and Refind is not yet ready for it. So here is the solution to get your dual boot half back. It won&amp;rsquo;t fully work as expected, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to boot to Linux with Refind and Mac OS X with the alt key.</description>

I wanted one with a good autonomy. And a recent firmware update grew from 7 days to 14 the number of days the battery autonomy. I also wanted a strap able to give me information on night I&amp;rsquo;ve spent, doesn&amp;rsquo;t let me sleep all the afternoon during a siesta.</description>

You can have a look on last log and directly in the same interface the diff of the current commit. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached one screenshot to let you see how cool it is.
The are also a lot of other features but just for browsing purpose. You can&amp;rsquo;t update or make changes.</description>

      <description>Fig is a fast, isolated development environments using Docker. For some features, it can be compared to Vagrant where the Dockerfike is not enough powerful to build multiple instances.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to test a new product version of a software like MediaWiki and you want to build the complete stack. So you may need to have several tools categories (depending of the usage):
 Web: Nginx, PHP-FPM, Varnish App Cahing: Redis Search: ElasticSearch  In Vagrant you can natively build 3 VM and interconnect them without the need of additional tool.</description>

It is able to manage several repositories, making snapshots, merging snapshots, diff between 2 snapshots, filtering packages to avoid downloading unwanted ones&amp;hellip;.
This is perfect when you want to test before upgrading a critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>One of my ex-boss talked to me about Coursera a year ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a website where you can freely learn several things from high graduated school. Most ofter, it&amp;rsquo;s technology related and I wanted to test it to learn Java.
I subscribed to 2 sessions. One for the java basics and the other one for the object oriented aspect (in french). I&amp;rsquo;ve started it a few weeks ago the first part and what I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very good.</description>

      <title>Galera Innoptimizer: now support tables’ partition</title>

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/galera-innoptimizer-now-support-tables-partition/</guid>
      <description>You may remember the first introduction of that tool here. I&amp;rsquo;ve made changes to support tables&amp;rsquo; partition, to avoid a big lock on huge tables.
The solution is to rebuild every partition one by one instead of rebuilding the whole table. This is smoother and less stressing Galera. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this new version (v0.2).
Note: I still got issues on MariaDB 10 with such thing, I&amp;rsquo;m working on it.</description>

      <description>The first thing you generally want to do when you have any new Storage system like SSD, Disk arrays or a Cluster Ceph, is benching. You will want to know how can read and write throughput. FIO is able to do that for you, here is an example:
[global] ioengine=libaio invalidate=1 ramp_time=5 direct=1 size=5G runtime=300 time_based directory=/home [seq-read] rw=read bs=64K stonewall [rand-read] rw=randread bs=4K stonewall [seq-write] rw=write bs=64K stonewall [rand-write] rw=randwrite bs=4K stonewall  You then will have a good output of everything you need to know.</description>

      <description>Cyanogen is finally available on Sumsung Galaxy S5 Europe (klte) :-). Thanks Cyanogen Team! For the moment, you can only grab nighly builds but everything is working fine on it.
Regarding the difference with the Samsung ROM, I noticed the battery life time is a little bit reduced (up to 15% depending on your usage). Camera is working fine, calls, screen etc&amp;hellip; are ok too. I only have minor bugs that I don&amp;rsquo;t really care in fact.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things that may frustrate you with Sphinxdoc and ReadTheDocs. ReadTheDocs has a beautiful theme and you certainly want to use it with Sphinxdoc. However the size of the main text may be too small for you. Or you noticed that when you try to generate a version locally you&amp;rsquo;ll see it works like a charm but when it&amp;rsquo;s compiled on Readthedocs, it will fail.
Here is a solution on how to make it work both locally and on Readthedocs:</description>

      <description>I recently been faced on a classical problem on InnoDB which is the fragmentation, but on Galera. InnoDB engine doesn&amp;rsquo;t defragment on the fly and requires optimize maintenance sometimes to free disk space. But on Galera, which is a fault tolerance and high availability solution, it&amp;rsquo;s a problem having tables locked by an optimize procedure. Until Galera doesn&amp;rsquo;t support TokuDB and only fully support InnoDB, we had (with a colleague (Kevin aka Vinek)) to find a solution.</description>

      <description>Like me you may heard of Netflix for the first time a few months ago because of the announcement in Europe. However it&amp;rsquo;s a massively used solution in the US since several years.
Today Netflix is out and you can freely have a month to discover Netflix. For the moment there are not a lot of films and series, but enough in my opinion to be an interesting solution. Of course because of the French laws, films are more than 3 years old and I hope this will change or I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it will be competitive enough.</description>

      <description>I recently talked about Sphinxdoc and we wanted (still for MySecureShell project) a solution to host our documentation. ReadTheDocs is a very good, free and pretty solution made for Sphinxdoc :-)
What we liked in addition of the hosting, is the usage with GitHub. You can configure a webhook to your GitHub account to automatically ask ReadTheDocs to build a newer version each time a commit is pushed on your GitHub account.</description>

      <description>The day has finally come! After several months of intensive work (weekends and nights), I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that my book on MariaDB High Performance is out!
In that book, I made my best to make things as simple as possible to test features, test solutions and to explain everything in the simplest way. Of course if you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner on MariaDB (and Linux), it may be hard. But if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with basics and want to go further with performances and high availability on MariaDB, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it.</description>

      <description>I already heard of Sphinxdoc a year ago and see some of my colleges are using it for professional or personal usages. With my friend Sebastien Tardif (Teka101), we decided to rebuild a complete documentation for MySecureShell in a more fashion way as the old doculentation starts looking ugly. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s more an oriented Python solution, it can be used for any other kind of project and we decided to use SphinxDoc to make a newer documentation.</description>

# HSTS (force users to come in SSL if they&amp;#39;ve already been once) add_header Strict-Transport-Security &amp;quot;max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains&amp;quot;;  If you want to have an overview of a complete configuration with it, look at the my wiki.</description>

      <description>Because of the recent announce from DotDeb about PHP 5.6 availability on Debian, I saw that I totally forgot to move from PHP 5.4 to 5.5.
As I&amp;rsquo;m hosting several WordPress, Mediawiki, Piwik and other PHP web software, I was not very comfortable with that migration. I knew that the major change was on PHP cache. I was intensively using APC cache but in PHP 5.5, it is deprecated and Opcache replace it.</description>

 Does not retain some default preferences Forget to make some thumbnails when importing a lot of photos in several albums etc&amp;hellip;  I tested AWS backups and even if the price is correct, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow for restoring in my opinion.</description>

I decided to adapt those rules to block bruteforce login attack for WordPress. The problem is WordPress is not returning 403 error code when a user fail to logon but return a 200 instead :-/.</description>

Neo4j is a highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph database. Neo4j is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading startups, enterprises, and governments around the world.
I you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is a graph database, it&amp;rsquo;s a very good introduction and will help you to understand what it is and how it works.</description>

Starting from scratch each time is a little bit boring, that&amp;rsquo;s why I created a preseed file (french). That made the install automatically, however I always had to do other step by hands (or need to write a script for it).</description>

Regarding the CPU side, I do not have an easy answer for the moment :-(. However regarding the memory, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Nagios/Naemon check which will check the memory (RAM) and SWAP of a container. Here is how to use it:</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why after a few seconds of search, I&amp;rsquo;ve found an extension for Mediawiki which is working perfectly called TitleKey.
 The TitleKey extension provides a case-insensitive title prefix search. It uses a separate table for the keys, so if it works cleanly it can be deployed without an expensive rebuild of core tables, and dumped when Wikimedia gets a nicer backend through Extension:LuceneSearch (pre 1.</description>

However, a version 1.0.4 exist on Debian Jessie. I took the Debian sources and recompiled them on Wheezy (available here).</description>

      <description>I am using Nagios for about 8 years now for personal and professional usage. What I can say is, this is a super product, old and stable but not as scalable as I would like. We&amp;rsquo;re in the age of Cloud computing and in my opinion we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to take care about backup and monitoring in now days, this should be automatic.
I was searching a solution for my personal usages, that&amp;rsquo;s why I first wanted a lightweight solution but with enough maturity to auto discover my newly created LXC containers.</description>

      <description>I recently talked about Gogs and really like this solution. The main problem I encounter was the current stable version which may not be usable on Debian.
Here is a quick solution to make it work. First of all, install git:
apt-get install git  Then you can download the latest compiled version directly from gobuild.
wget http://gobuild.io/github.com/gogits/gogs/master/linux/amd64 -O output.zip unzip output.zip ./start.sh  You can now access to port 3000.</description>

      <description>I was using Gitweb for about 3 years now and wanted to have a more enhanced web version. I started to look at 3 solutions for my own needs. So my comparison is for my own usage with 2 or 3 friends at max and not for enterprise:
 GitHub: can make free public and paid private repositories. Sounds very good, the most powerful solution of the market in my opinion.</description>

      <description>I really like working on ElasticSearch, so powerful, so easy to use, so scalable and so high available. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a very interresting book I bought on it.
It will help you to start with ElasticSearch and answer a lot of question you may have regarding the product. If you want to buy it, take a look there.</description>

      <description>During the last weeks I started to play with Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana. I made a documentation to help on deploying it easily.
As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m an Ansible fan, so I made Ansible playbooks to deploy a complete infrastructure (server and clients). They will deploy this kind of architecture:
On the client side, Fluentd clients will get syslog and Nginx logs, to send them to the Fluentd server. On the server side, a Fluentd receiver will be there to get data from other Fluentd clients.</description>

      <description>In the previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve introduced my Ansible playbooks for kibana and Elasticsearch.
You may now be happy to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve made an Ansible playbook for Fluentd as well. If you still don&amp;rsquo;t see what those tree ansible playbook can do when they are combined together, you&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next post :-)</description>

      <description>In my last post you&amp;rsquo;ve seen the Ansible playbook I&amp;rsquo;ve made for ElasticSearch. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a new one, but for Kibana which is able to easily manage version upgrade and of course is easy to install and use.
You can find my Kibana playbook on GitHub.
The next once will of course be related to fluentd :-)</description>

      <description>My use case is specific but not isolated. When I&amp;rsquo;m at work, I&amp;rsquo;m connected to my VPN at home. I have a specific DNS at home for my domain in deimos.lan and this is very useful to avoid me to remind all the IP of the services I have.
Sometimes, I want to connect to a home service from the VPN, but my bookmarked links have my home DNS which are unknown from the DNS at work.</description>

      <description>Ubiquiti brings software that are easy to install on Windows and Mac OS. However as it is strongly recommended to let this software always up, it&amp;rsquo;s preferable to have a Linux version to run it in a container or a virtual machine. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to install it for a powerstrip mPower on Debian inside LXC.
The documentation is very poor, that&amp;rsquo;s why I made this one for those who want to do like me.</description>

      <description>In previous posts, I was talking about brainfucks I had when migrating OpenBSD from a version to another. I really love OpenBSD but this fed me up a couple of years ago.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to test and switch to FreeBSD. Which one I forgot to upgrade since a while and I decided to do it to see if it&amp;rsquo;s the same nightmare I encountered on OpenBSD.
I was surprised by the simplicity of the upgrade and how things happens without any issues.</description>

      <description>Seafile is a Google Drive replacement. If you missed m&amp;rsquo;y previous blog post on it, you can find it here.
I really like Seafile even if a search feature is missing :-(. Seafile client is unfortunately not an available solution on all software proposing a cloud connection for sharing files.
Hopefully an alternative exists using Webdav protocol. It is not activated by default on Seafile but can easily be enable. Here is how to do it.</description>

Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager.  And hopefully I found very good documentations on Internet (and especially on Arch wiki). I&amp;rsquo;ve made a summary on my wiki if you want to know how to diagnose a Systemd issue.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re in fact waiting on a lot of work on the kernel side or systemd side. More information&amp;rsquo;s can be found here. Another solution that permit to bind a socks inside containers exists called CGManager, however classical tools doesn&amp;rsquo;t use it to get informations.</description>

No major visual changes between the previous version 1.22 and this one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t had to touch anything on my JS, CSS or configuration! Great!
I encountered an issue with my GoogleSearch extension and made the changes to make it work again. So a new version (0.</description>

 If you already use Docker to setup your dev box for large applications, don&amp;rsquo;t you suffer to maintain complex Dockerfiles?
Splitting a service Oriented Architecture into several Docker containers is the solution, except managing links and mounts between them is a pain. gaudi solves that by offering a way to describe a system of Docker containers using a simple DSL.</description>

Calamari is composed in 2 elements:
 Backend: the Calamari backend is written in Python 2.6+, using Saltstack, ZeroRPC, gevent, Django, django-rest-framework, graphite, (and a few others I may have forgotten) and instantiates a new REST API for integration with other systems.</description>

The strategies and architectures that influence CoreOS allow companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter to run their services at scale with high resilience. We&amp;rsquo;ve implemented them correctly so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to endure the slow, learn-as-you-go infrastructure building process. &amp;gt; &amp;gt; CoreOS can run on your existing hardware or on most cloud providers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Docker a year ago, started to play with it for some months and really start using it a few days ago. At first, I thought it was more complex than expected and finally I saw how simple it is and how many time I&amp;rsquo;ve lost because I didn&amp;rsquo;t used it.
Docker is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.</description>

After starting reading it, I could find this:

      <description>I recently changed my smartphone (yes once again) because I was very interested in Galaxy S5 features compared to Nexus 5:
 Waterproof: better when you got child&amp;rsquo;s and can record video underwater! Better autonomy: I can have a normal day without charging it! Better camera: once again when you have child&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;The camera makes very good photos compared to Nexus 5. Bigger screen: not a big point for me but it is better Storage: can add a micro SD card.</description>

      <description>Last week, have been faced on a big sniffing issue on my wiki. The guy wanted to download all my wiki content. In reality I do not really care as it is open, free for read and contribution is welcome. However, the current VM where the blog and wiki are running didn&amp;rsquo;t support aggressive sniffing that this guy made. That&amp;rsquo;s why CPUs were at 100% of usage because of PHP requests, PHP-FPM was overloaded (reached my configuration limits).</description>

I didn&amp;rsquo;t really follow OpenZFS and hope we could see videos when the event will be finished. If you don&amp;rsquo;t really know about ZFS and can have the chance to assist, I strongly recommend it to you.

I started to rewrite my Puppet manifests to Ansible playbooks and what I can say is it&amp;rsquo;s really fast and easy.</description>

      <description>Regarding one of my latest post, talking about Fluentd, some of you asked me why I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Fluentd instead of Logstash. First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at this blog post, which kindly resume the current situation. Looking at this and with feedback I got, I could establish this array:
   Logstash  Fluentd   Concerns  Flexibility/Interoperability  Simplicity/Robustness   Language  JRuby  Cruby   Inputs  More  Fewer   Inputs specs  Basics  Scalables   Plugins  Lot  Lot more   Plugins install  Simple (drop a jar)  Can be complex (dependencies)   Logs send crypt  Yes  Yes   Scalability  Forward to 2 hosts  LB A/A or A/P   Reliability  Can loss messages  No message loss    Logstash and Fluentd are both powerful solutions, they both got pros and cons.</description>

      <description>Next Wednesday, a meetup will take place in Paris talking about Elasticsearch. My previous post was talking about a log solution using Elasticsearch.
During that meetup, an overview of how Elasticsearch powerful real-time capabilities enrich Hadoop development. The session will showcase how to perform real-time searches on top and within Hadoop, Hive, Pig or Cascading jobs to get better answers, fast.
We&amp;rsquo;ll cover architectural topics such as index scalability, data locality and partitioning between the Hadoop cluster and the search index, using off and on-premise storages (HDFS, S3, local file-systems) and multi-tenancy.</description>

      <description>Managing logs is not a complicated tasks with classical syslog systems (syslog-ng, rsyslog&amp;hellip;). However, being able to search in them quickly when you have several gigabit of logs, with scalability, with a nice graphical interface etc&amp;hellip;is not the same thing.
Hopefully today, tools that permit to do it very well exists, here are the list of tools that&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to achieve it:
 Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a flexible and powerful open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine.</description>

 The mysqlnd library is highly optimized for and tightly integrated into PHP. The MySQL Client Library cannot offer the same optimizations because it is a general-purpose client library.</description>

      <description>My last post was about existing alternatives to Dropbox. I also mentioned that I was trying Seafile.
I&amp;rsquo;m running now Seafile since a few days now and it works without any issues. The Linux and Android clients works very well. I just hope a sync feature in the Android version will appear. Regarding the web version, there are all attending collaboration features and that&amp;rsquo;s great. Seafile supports file versioning and trash bin.</description>

      <description>Recently a new person as joined the administration of Dropbox called Condoleezza Rice. The problem is: this person is known to have allowed phone tapping in the US. So should be thrust in Dropbox anymore ?
For me not really. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to look at alternatives. I already tested Owncloud but was plenty of bugs. Also a french post about that situation has been made.
I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at alternatives and Seafile looks like the best alternative to Dropbox and Owncloud.</description>

      <description>The Percona replication manager (PRM) is a framework using the Linux HA resource agent Pacemaker that manages replication and provides automatic failover. This covers the installation of the framework on a set of servers. The PRM framework is made of 4 components: Corosync, Pacemaker, the mysql resource agent and MySQL itself.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to setup, better if you already know how to use Pacemaker and it works like a charm. In fact it setup a master and x slaves.</description>

After researches, it looked like that i3blocks it the best alternative. So I contacted the creator (Vivien) and had very good exchanges with him.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made pull requests and suggestions to integrate missing checks, faster one that I developed and with colorization depending of the contexts.</description>

First of all, I had to be in recovery mod (bottom button + vol up + power). Then I wanted to create a /sdcard but it didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mount and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to format my sdcard. So I mounted a tmpfs onto it:</description>

      <description>NAXSI means Nginx Anti Xss &amp;amp; Sql Injection. Technically, it is a third party nginx module, available as a package for many UNIX-like platforms. This module, by default, reads a small subset of simple rules (naxsi_core.rules) containing 99% of known patterns involved in websites vulnerabilities. For example, &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt; &amp;lsquo;, &amp;lsquo;|&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;drop&amp;rsquo; are not supposed to be part of a URI.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I wanted to test NAXSI and it seams working not so bad.</description>

A few months ago, a friend (@sebastien_han) show me Aviate and switched to it. This is an interface that helps you day to day to show you informations and apps you need depending on your localization. I really love it!
Last week I discovered Cover which is a solution for the lockscreen.</description>

      <description>In France, we have the chance to have an ISP/Mobile Telephony provider called Free. They considerably reduced the market price for the Mobile phone communications in 2012. This was very fine for competition and for French people. Now we can have correct prices for Internet and cell phone data. Thanks to Free.
Ceph is quite the same as Free but for storage systems. Since many years, disks array constructors sold us locked solutions with a very high cost of hardware and licenses&amp;rsquo; software.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to make a new test with it and it&amp;rsquo;s now adopted. I spent a little bit time on reconfiguring all my needs (workspaces depending my screen configuration, opening app on a defined workspace, keyboard bindings etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

When I switched to Nexus 4, it was not too bad, but I sometimes had problems on updates that forced me to restore.</description>

 Replication  MariaDB 10 sets a new standard in performance. It is many times faster than previous generations of MariaDB and especially legacy database MySQL thanks to new features including parallel replication and a further advanced group commit. Also, the replication slaves are now crash-safe. It’s also now possible to replicate data from multiple master servers giving a complete view of the distributed data across big datasets for real-time analytical purposes via the multi-source replication feature.</description>

      <description>Some of you will tell me that most utility is doing it as well. And that&amp;rsquo;s right, but with ccze you will be able to colorize everything with a pipe. For example when you play with a verbose service like Pacemaker, you need to get colorization if you want to win time. Here is an example:
tail -f /var/log/syslog | ccze -A  </description>

      <description>One of my colleague (Julien Danjou) wrote a book on advanced usage of Python. The book was out today and I strongly recommend buying it. Here is the summary of it:
 Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and more in many different industries. It is fast, flexible, and it comes with batteries included.
Most of the books you read about Python will teach you the language basics – but once you&amp;rsquo;ve learnt them, you’re on your own in designing your application and discovering best practice.</description>

      <description>If you want to easily build a static webpage with parallax effect, you can try the Cool Kitten framework. It is a young project that already have cool stuffs like grids solution, responsive design etc&amp;hellip;It uses Normalize.css, jQuery Easing Plugin and Stellar.js.
You need nodejs to minify CSS but do not need nodejs server to run it, as it is static HTML pages.

      <description>A meetup on Ansible and SaltStack will take place in Paris next Monday. It unfortunately has not been initiated on the traditional meet up website and you may missed it like me.
So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested by those two configuration tool outsiders, follow the link. Both tools are written in Python, that why it is a Python meetup at first.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to participate to the meetup as this is the first one, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll learn interesting things on it and meet new faces :-)</description>

      <description>Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. You can win a lot of time by testing your application on multiple environments (AWS, OpenStack, VirtualBox, Vmware&amp;hellip;).
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve got a LAMP environment to deploy in production on OpenStack. However, you can&amp;rsquo;t perform your development/integration on it as you don&amp;rsquo;t have access yet. You can&amp;rsquo;t loose time and wait for it to test.</description>

      <description>When you have a huge amount of mail to deliver, you can&amp;rsquo;t release the queue at once and let the server maximize the outgoing mail throughput ! The result will be: you&amp;rsquo;ll get blacklisted from a lot of MX servers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why you should take care of it and do traffic shaping. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little tips on it.</description>

You can find my boxes here. If you want to add one, it&amp;rsquo;s really simple:
vagrant box add deimosfr/debian-wheezy  And the second awesome feature is&amp;hellip;the sharing! You can for example have access to a distant and nated Vagrant instance through SSH!</description>

      <description>I recently played with HAProxy and discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a documentation regarding this fantastic software. So if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what HAProxy is, it&amp;rsquo;s a load balancer working on layer 7 and specialized for http protocol.
It is able to handle sticky sessions which is really powerful. More than that, it has a small footprint and can work under a high load traffic.
Here is my documentation.</description>

      <description>One of my colleague (Sebastien Han) started to play (like me) with Ansible. As he is a Ceph master, he often deploy Ceph for tests or production. He generally uses Puppet for that purpose.
But due to some Puppet limitations or big brain fuck it involves, he started to play with Ansible and created a Ceph module for it. He showed me it, when he was writing it and it seamed working like a charm.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while now that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Ansible but I only started playing with a week ago. You may certainly know that I&amp;rsquo;m a Puppet lover, but this solution is more powerful than Puppet in my opinion.
So I started to migrate my personal Puppet to Ansible just to play with. Here are the pros:
 No client needed on the clients, only SSH! It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python By default a lot of modules Not only a configuration management tool, it&amp;rsquo;s an orchestrator too!</description>

      <description>If you already played with Puppet&amp;rsquo;s environments, you certainly know that the major problem is the static form of them. When you want to test something new (a module for example), it&amp;rsquo;s not quite easy without using environments. r10k bring the dynamic feature and easy module managment !
It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to maintain your modules without using a lot of git submodules. Simply declare your modules informations like that:
mod &amp;#39;filemapper&amp;#39;, :git =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;git://github.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered a Vagrant plugin that manage the VirtualBox Guest Additions automatically. I mean, when you launch a virtual machine, it automatically checks if the Guest Additions are installed. If it&amp;rsquo;s not the case or if they are not up to date, installation of the latest version is made automatically !
Here is how to install it.</description>

      <description>Several persons asked me how could they do slides like I did with MySQL/MariaDB for example. I mentioned that I used LaTeX with Beamer and they were all frighten by the technology and language (takes too long time to be able to use it).
I think that&amp;rsquo;s not totally wrong but once you&amp;rsquo;ve understand how it works&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. So for colleagues and friends, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation on how to use beamer and provided a template to get a quick start on it.</description>

      <description>Big resolution with small screens is more and more common and we&amp;rsquo;re facing a problem on fonts visualization as the readability is not optimal. We have a lot of non adapted fonts for retina display, even if most of them are not so bad. The solution to resolve that problem is to install additional fonts to replace the default one. And one of the best one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is Infinality fonts !</description>

      <description>Yesterday a colleague (Dimitri) tested a tool on this blog. He informed me that Varnish was disabled and PageSpeed may be the cause as this is the last modification I&amp;rsquo;ve made on the server.
After verification he was totally right ! By default, PageSpeed disable cache by serving HTML files with:
Cache-Control: no-cache, max-age=0  After reading the PageSpeed documentation on that topic, it is clear: PageSpeed needs to know how to purge the cache as it rewrites a lot of elements and it has the control instead of the application.</description>

What I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to take the time to test every optimizations you want to add. I experienced for example issues on silly things like :
# Optimize browser rendering pagespeed EnableFilters lazyload_images;  Some images weren&amp;rsquo;t shown if you didn&amp;rsquo;t refresh once again your page browser. I only had this problem on the blog and not the wiki.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve first heard of Page Speed last year for Apache. I was really waiting a stable version for Nginx and it&amp;rsquo;s now done. A few days ago, Nicolargo made a post regarding it and that&amp;rsquo;s what motivated me to go ahead on Page Speed.
PageSpeed speeds up your site and reduces page load time. This open-source webserver module automatically applies web performance best practices to pages and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow.</description>

      <description>Once again the FOSDEM has given awesome talks ! This years I was more focused to SQL and NOSQL databases. I wanted to also see Puppet related conferences, but they were full like the last year.
Getting started with MySQL Performance Schema
First of all, I started with a MySQL Performance Schema presentation :
http://dimitrik.free.fr/mysqltechday_2013_10/MySQL_PFS_2013-dim.pdf
I saw that I had underestimated the power of Performance schema ! We can for example see iowaits and waiting time on tables files.</description>

      <description>Some of you may already know that I&amp;rsquo;ve been contacted by Packt Publishing to write a book.
As every aware persons asked me why I was contacted, here is the story :
When I was working for Linagora, I gave a training on advanced usage on MySQL/MariaDB. Unfortunately there weren&amp;rsquo;t slides on that subject at this moment and I had to make them all. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did and made an unbranded version for me as well.</description>

      <description>I already talked about nftables and it has now been implemented in the 3.13 kernel !
For those who never heard of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a kernel built in replacement of iptables. All features are not there yet but should be implemented in 3.15.
If you like Packet Filter, you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy. If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure of the advantages of it, simply read that short comparison and you&amp;rsquo;ll be convinced : https://home.</description>

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2014/01/23/offloading-ssl-with-nginx-and-varnish/</guid>
      <description>Varnish is a real powerful cache solution for web servers. He is unfortunately not able to do it over SSL. Anyway, there is a solution by offloading it with Nginx. Here is a schema to get a better understanding :
Nginx decrypt SSL, pass it in clear to Varnish. If Varnish got it, replies to Nginx which crypt back data to send to user.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a full documentation to get it working well, follow the link.</description>

      <description>In addition of object storage, Ceph is able to provide block devices. Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.
For example this is used to store Virtual Machines on OpenStack. With that solution, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a real fault tolerance system for your VM and distributed.
The RBD part is an easy task when you&amp;rsquo;ve already setup a Ceph cluster.</description>

      <description>CloudFlare is a Free solution to load your website faster and add security. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it 2 days ago, that&amp;rsquo;s why you may experienced issues in accessing the blog and wiki.
I had issues on WordPress, so I need to correct some problems relating images (http/https) as the Free version of CloudFlare doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SSL. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve roll back for the moment.
I have other kind of modifications to make on WordPress before it works as it should.</description>

      <description>Following the previous post, on Ceph Storage, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation with informations to play with OSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered :
 Setup OSD Remove OSD Use Ceph Ojects Storage  Using the object storage system is not complicated and easily scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s a real pleasure to work with that kind of solutions. If you&amp;rsquo;re already working with other objects storage solutions, you won&amp;rsquo;t be lost.</description>

      <description>I finally started to play with Ceph to add it in production. I&amp;rsquo;m still impressed by this storage solution. Just to remind, Ceph is an open-source, massively scalable, software-defined storage system which provides object, block and file system storage (not yet ready for production usage) in a single platform. It runs on commodity hardware-saving you costs, giving you flexibility. And as it’s in the Linux kernel, it’s easy to consume.</description>

      <description>Cgroups permit to restrict a process to specific hardware like CPU or limiting IO disk etc&amp;hellip; Managing it manually could be a nightmare and hopefully, a good workaround exists.
It&amp;rsquo;s called cgconfig and allows you to have a running daemon to apply restrictions on all new running process. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation for it and spent time on it as it&amp;rsquo;s not properly Debian packaged yet :-(</description>

      <description>Piwik 2.0 has been released a few days ago. The upgrade of my version was done without any issues (as a rule with Piwik).
I like the look of this new version and like the new mobile application on Android. It&amp;rsquo;s really better organized and really looks like as an application (compared with the first version).
There are some new interesting features for professionals (not for my personal usage).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good alternative to Google Analytics and you should try it.</description>

      <description>On android, you may need some folder to no being indexed. It could be photos or videos&amp;hellip;
To do so, use a ES Explorer for example and a &amp;lsquo;.nomedia&amp;rsquo; file inside the desired folder.
No index will be done in that folder. I like to do it when I temporary add TV series and don&amp;rsquo;t want them to be indexed. By this way I don&amp;rsquo;t see them in the Gallery application for example.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to set a website in maintenance and wanted to do it as quickly as possible with any restart of Nginx.
The idea is to add a maintenance.html page at the root of your web folder and then the maintenance page is automatically taken into account.
To do it, simply follow the link (in french).</description>

      <description>In those time, security is more and more important. Some vulnerabilities have been discovered and security on your SSL should be added. In fact you need to restrict the possibilities to your SSL server to avoid SSL breaks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation to add SSL Resumption and authorized ciphers algorithms.
Then you can check your SSL server security here : https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html.
I hope this will help you.</description>

      <description>Once again, I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded my wiki (wiki.deimos.fr) and it was really easy with git.
We could see some new minor design changes like &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; banners or the login page. Other interesting features are appearing like load time informations for each page edition or embedding Vector theme in the Core. A new extension manager is used called Composer and will try to look at it&amp;rsquo;s benefits shortly.
Once again, thanks Mediawiki !</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve tested the rc2, but it&amp;rsquo;s too much unstable for the moment and I need to wait. Arch wiki gives a lot of informations to make (most of) everything working :</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally finished my documentation on LXC for Debian Wheezy. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve added the most interesting features.
I&amp;rsquo;m now going to migrate my servers from KVM to LXC as I only POC it for now. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you up to date when everything will be migrated.</description>

      <title>LXC : use dnsmasq instead of libvirt</title>
      <link>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2013/11/28/lxc-use-dnsmasq-instead-of-libvirt/</link>

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2013/11/28/lxc-use-dnsmasq-instead-of-libvirt/</guid>
      <description>LXC is a really good container solution to replace older container solutions like OpenVZ or Vserver for instance. Libvirt is a wonderful tool to manage different hypervisors and containers solutions. Anyway Libvirt is unfortunately not able to fully manage LXC (create, delete&amp;hellip;) today.
That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to get it running and installed on a server, but it could be useful if you have KVM and LXC working on the same machine to get the same tool to handle start/stop containers/VMs.</description>

So I have bought the 32G and will be happy to get the photo stabilizer. Those are the major enhancement that makes me take the new Nexus.
I&amp;rsquo;m waiting the Cyanogen ROM to get all advanced features I like and hope it will be available soon.</description>

      <description>The lego calendar is a wall mounted time planner that we invented for our studio. It’s made entirely of lego, but if you take a photo of it with a smartphone all of the events and timings will be magically synchronised to an online, digital calendar. It makes the most of the tangibility of physical objects, and the ubiquity of digital platforms, and it’s also puts a smile on our faces when we use it!</description>

Two of my colleagues (Julien and Axel) praise virtues of this application. So I started to use it yesterday. For the moment, my opinion is good during the night, but during the day&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t have opinion for the moment.
Here is my configuration.</description>

Anyway, I had problem with permissions on the USB device and found a udev solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation and let you check and would like a feedback if some of you have encountered the same issue (USB error: Access denied (insufficient permissions))</description>

      <description>Galera uses a preallocated file with a specific size called gcache, used to store the writesets in circular buffer style. By default, its size is 128MB and it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to upgrade it to a higher value.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation on that if you want to check. In addition, you can find more informations, I suggest a Severalnines link.</description>

Nagios 4 is the latest Core version of the project ! Only the enterprise version will remain (strategic choice of Ethan, the creator).
A Nagios 4 fork will appear called Naemon and developed by Andreas Ericsson. I remind as well that the Shinken is a real good alternative and is able to work with your current Nagios configuration.</description>

      <description>I recently crypted all my disk as I changed laptop. At the beginning, I just tested a simple password to see performances changes.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t really see changes for the moment.
Once I&amp;rsquo;ve finished to install and configure my needs, I wanted to have a strong password solution. I decided to use a remembered password concatenated to a generated yubikey password.
I updated my LUKS tutorial to explain how to update the password.</description>

      <description>I tested to install Debian as I love it more than Mac OS X for work on my new MacBook Pro 13 retina. Most of the hardware works out of the box on a Debian Jessie (because of the kernel version &amp;gt; 3.8) but is not really optimal. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I did to make it better.
First of all, you need an EFI manager. I discovered that Refit is not maintained anymore and let place to rEFInd instead.</description>

      <description>Yes I did it ! I finally switched from my fantastic Lenovo to the latest MacBook Pro 13.
Some of you won&amp;rsquo;t understand why I did it, but in fact you&amp;rsquo;ll see this is an evidence. What was the problem with the Lenovo ? Just the weight ! I&amp;rsquo;m usually transporting it from work to home and vice versa. I now have a backache and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue like that. Hopefully eNovance is a comprehensive company and allowed me to switch to another laptop of my choice.</description>

Easy to install, it gives the major features of a standard tiling window manager. This is a must have for me now on OS X.

Using the tool two or more visitors on a website or web application can see each other’s mouse/cursor position, clicks, track each other’s browsing, edit forms together, watch videos together, and chat via audio and WebRTC.
Plugins already exist for WordPress and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate in any website :-).</description>

This time, I&amp;rsquo;m asking help to find a good load testing tool. The one I know is Tsung but it&amp;rsquo;s not able to speak to some social API. I would like to know what kind of solution you are using and your feedback on it. I already played with Jmeter and I do not remind that it&amp;rsquo;s able to do better.
Any help is appreciated :-)

      <description>A little bit fed up about changing window manager to find the best one for my needs, after i3, I&amp;rsquo;m testing DWM.
I3 was really nice, but got too much limitation from my point of view. The configuration is too static while Awesome really flexible so the change was hard. An old colleague reminds me about DWM and gave me a real good feedback on it as he&amp;rsquo;s using it daily since a long time now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Awesome WM for a few months and really like it&amp;rsquo;s modular LUA configuration file. But I encounter some little problems with window resizing that waste my time day to day and forced me to look at an alternative.
A colleague who encountered the same issue talked to Awesome creator (Julien Danjou) that I sometimes have the chance to see at eNovance. It looks like a complicated bug to resolve, he&amp;rsquo;s not the core maintainer anymore and as it will take too much time to resolve it, this bug shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fixed one day.</description>

With some colleges of eNovance, we&amp;rsquo;re currently participating to the Ceph Day today in London (http://www.inktank.com/CEPHdays/).
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be here, as I wanted to put in production Ceph, 4-5 years ago (when it was released as experimental in Linux Kernel).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been interested in NAS solutions as I&amp;rsquo;ve always made my own server and installed what I needed manually. In addition I always thought that it was closed sources since a friend show me I was wrong.
He definitively convinced me and I bought a Synology DS713+ last week. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to use, brings a lot of features and the biggest point : it&amp;rsquo;s an open system. I mean that you can have root access on a busy box and do what you want.</description>

View them on SpeakerDeck.com, or share them on any website with an embed code. More than that, it produces HTML 5 slides and there are no Ads :-)
I&amp;rsquo;m fed up about slideshare which doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow as it should be. They still produce flash slides and as many people, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it anymore.</description>

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2013/09/27/windows-service-action-on-a-website-pattern/</guid>
      <description>I recently made a script at work to act as a service when a pattern is found (or not) on a website. You can also run pre and post script if you want.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Windows binary that you can find on my GitHub or on my Git.
I did it in Perl. As described in the last post as I needed to have the interpreter embedded in the binary. I&amp;rsquo;m so bad to find good application name that I called it url_service_action.</description>

      <description>In the past, I already made an article on how to make exe from a Perl script on Windows. I was using Strawberry or Activesync but have a preference for Strawberry as it&amp;rsquo;s totally free :-).
This time, I tried to reproduce the tips but encountered several issues. The first one was that error :
The locale codeset (cp1252) isn&amp;#39;t one that perl can decode, stopped at Encode/Locale.pm line 94.  It could simply be resolved by addressing &amp;lsquo;-x&amp;rsquo; parameter to the &amp;lsquo;pp&amp;rsquo; command line.</description>

The last version of JetPack, brings a newcomer to the social sharing solution : Google +.
I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled it, that mean in addition of this blog and Twitter, you&amp;rsquo;ll now be able to follow me on Google + :-)</description>

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2013/09/19/shell-back-to-directory-command-bd/</guid>
      <description>I recently read a post (on Korben&amp;rsquo;s blog) regarding a command called bd to go back to a directory from you current full path. It permits to do more than that !
In fact this is a simple shell script, but it really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re in a long subfolder list. For example if you reside in &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever&amp;rsquo; and want to change to &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/test&amp;rsquo;, then try &amp;lsquo;bd p`/test.
If you want to see all the possibilities, you can look at the main site project.</description>

      <description>As said in a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get Internet through FTTH (Fiber To The Home). Unfortunately I won&amp;rsquo;t get a fixed IP like I currently have with my ADSL provider.
It reminds me Internet 10 years before, when I needed to play with dyndns or no-ip to be able to connect to my house ISP. The story is now repeating but as I got real DNS instead, I need to send the modifications to my DNS Registrar instead.</description>

      <description>As you can see, I write more and more posts on LXC. The latest thing I worked on, was how to convert a host/vm to a LXC container. I needed to write a script for it as I didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I needed.
The script will remove unneeded elements in a Debian system, removing folders (dev,proc,sys), recreate devices and configure etc files. You can find more informations by following the link.</description>

I unfortunately have to leave Free for this year and hope I&amp;rsquo;ll could switch back to it in a year.
The bad news is I&amp;rsquo;ll have a random public IP :-(.</description>

      <description>What a topic ! It could sounds like a patent troll but let me explain why I posted it.
First of all, I do not have strong skills on Arch Linux, but so many people talked to me about it and have praised me the merit of that distribution that I absolutely needed to test it. Before, I was on Debian testing and had some setbacks that encouraged me to look ahead to find a better solution.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve write with emacs/vim or any other classical tool editor, a manifest or a Puppet module. If you did it, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of syntax errors or got errors during catalog compilation. During a long time, I was using Geppetto to help me on writing and suggesting better syntax to my manifest.
I took the latest available version of Geppetto but it crashes all the time.</description>

      <description>Awesome is still my window manager and I still love it. With my laptop, I need to be able to quickly get my working environment when I power it on. The major problem I had was to avoid having the same opened windows at boot if I&amp;rsquo;m in the train, at work or at home. Of course there is no GPS in the laptop to detect my location, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set a rule for it.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t really play with Puppet since a long time and a lot of things have changed.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing a Puppet module for MySecureShell. And the thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to quickly find the relevant information on how to build a module from scratch. I like to have experience return and what a chance when I saw a tweet regarding it, the same day as I started to write the module :-)</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m new to LXC, I am discovering how it works, see the maturity of the project and it&amp;rsquo;s integration in Debian. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a post a few weeks ago to introduce the basics and now I&amp;rsquo;m digging in advanced features.
I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered several issues. Most of them are not critical but unfortunately looks like a lack of integration on Debian.
 The first one is related to wheezy template and I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it in a previous post.</description>

I like this repository as it&amp;rsquo;s updated faster than the Debian one and you can have the latest version of some packages. Of course you can do package pinning if you only want one or a set of packages.
You can access to the repository here : http://www.dotdeb.org/</description>

      <description>Glances is a cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool written in Python.
It avoids to run several tools to get a all in one overview of your system. For example, when you want to quickly see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong on a system for diagnosis, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to launch top/htop, iostat, vmstat&amp;hellip;Glances gives you a large overview of your system health.
You can then investigate with the appropriate tool if you want. But you didn&amp;rsquo;t waste your time in opening several tools to get the first desired information : where does the problem comes from ?</description>

      <description>The goal of this documentation is how to quickly setup a monitoring screen machine for Nagios/Shinken. Several times in several company I had to do that kind of thing. On Mac OS and Linux.
I finished to create a documentation for the next times I&amp;rsquo;ll have to deploy such things. The idea is to have a machine that nobody never touch once installed. It&amp;rsquo;s always boring to plug a keyboard and a mouse when somethings goes wrong on this kind of machine that you normally never have to touch.</description>

As for LaTeX&amp;rsquo;s newbies it&amp;rsquo;s not really easy to start Beamer and as many people liked my last slides on MariaDB/MySQL. More than that, I had to make a presentation on DRBD at work and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write it with Beamer.
My colleagues appreciated the look and LaTeX format.</description>

      <description>You certainly know and have used the default MediaWiki search. It&amp;rsquo;s quite good but it&amp;rsquo;s not an optimal search. I wanted to have better one for my wiki that&amp;rsquo;s why I added Google search some years ago.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to setup Apache Lucene or Apache Solar as both are in Java. I always heard good feedback about Sphinx, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to add it at work and to my wiki as well.</description>

This feature is embedding videos without requesting additional extension and specific tags, it&amp;rsquo;s a built-in HTML5 media player. It was already possible to add videos but they weren&amp;rsquo;t playable directly on the page, it was a link.
As I manage the blog of my daughter, this is a really good news.</description>

      <description>Last week, I&amp;rsquo;ve assisted to a webinar organized by Puppet Labs. The talk was about PackStack which is a solution to deploy OpenStack in a production environment.
How does PackStack works ? Some of you may tell me that DevStack do the same thing. But I warn once again about DevStack which is absolutely not build for production usages ! PackStack is a bundle of current modules for OpenStack available on Puppet Forge.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a fast solution build on top of VirtualBox. I already talked about it in a previous post.
The thing is, you could do really more with Vagrant by adding Puppet manifests or Chef recipes in your Vagrant configuration file. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t often use one of those 2 softwares, it quickly could transform into a nightmare when they want to deploy softwares in addition of the OS.</description>

In addition, sometimes I need to set up a quick desktop environment with my preferences and deploy all I need may take a while. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve written some scripts (in Python and shell script) to help on deploying all my configuration and all the packages I wish.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone ! As you know I recently started to play with LXC :-)
At the beginning of my tests, I unfortunately found an annoying bug which avoid performing correct Debian installation over LVM.
I tried to resolve it by myself but didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to finish my investigation. After quick searches, I found that other people found the bug on github : https://github.com/simonvanderveldt/lxc-debian-wheezy-template/issues/1#issuecomment-21303483
As a rule, I searched it on Debian bugs list but nothing was reported.</description>

      <description>To finish my Galera&amp;rsquo;s posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote tips to help on maintenance and recover for the Galera Cluster (in french). As most of the time, Galera is able to manage automatically data recovering, some times (if split brain occurs for example) you need to manually do specific stuffs to recover the cluster.
I hope this will help some of you if problems occurs.</description>

In addition, there were some informations related to Galera Cluster running on top of MariaDB. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation to help on choosing the better SST method and understand the differences (in french).</description>

      <description>As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m a MediaWiki&amp;rsquo;s fan. I manage and use it since 2006 and you can see what I do with on my wiki.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always learned by myself, how to do things on MediaWiki as my needs were classical and for a single user. Some weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a big upgrade for the last company I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for (Linagora) and I wanted to implement interesting features for a multi users usage.</description>

      <description>Last week, I started to play with LXC. It is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtual system mechanism sometimes described as “chroot on steroids”.
LXC builds up from chroot to implement complete virtual systems, adding resource management and isolation mechanisms to Linux’s existing process management infrastructure.
I wanted to look at an alternative of OpenVZ and LXC seams to be the better solution. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to play with.</description>

      <description>For more than 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen IBM/Lenovo laptops and I really wanted one to try. Every users I met with this kind of laptop always told me that they are very happy with, are robust and got Linux supported drivers.
As I always wanted to get Mac instead of PC for my personnel usages, I never bought one. And as most of time, enterprises prefer cheap Dell than any other expensive robust laptop, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the chance to have a Lenovo till today.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I wanted to install as fast as possible new VMs headless. In addition, I wanted to give the possibility for my ex colleagues to be able to easily create remote VMs on my desktop as most of them got slow machines. KVM did the job perfectly. I also needed to quickly deploy Debian, so I made a pressed file.
Here at eNovance, I can be selfish :-p as everybody got a fast machine (Thanks eNovance).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought 2 Yubikeys several months ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t really took the time to play with them.
A ex-colleague took that time and configured it on his desktop under ArchLinux. I decided to play with it, see how could it works and with his help, put it in place in a very short time.
I configured it to work in parallel of my password. With that configuration, I do not need anymore typing my password, but only need to plug in my Yubikey.</description>

      <description>Installing old Debian to prepare a migration is quite good when repositories are still available. But for old unmaintained versions of Debian, we need to change some things.
Hopefully Debian still keep all the old versions in an archive repository that is accessible by changing the default url. Even if during install it fails, you can set it up afterward.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little article on it, follow the link.</description>

Fever answered most of them, instead of the mobile client. When I was on iPhone Reeder was nearly perfect, but not really Android with Meltdown.</description>

I think that most of my future topics will be related to my favorites subjects as this is what I was searching for : automation, high availability, devops and bests practices in production.</description>

      <description>For several years, I manually managed my MediaWiki instance manually and always upgraded manually, getting diffs, patching files etc&amp;hellip; Now it&amp;rsquo;s over, this method is simply not adapted to my needs.
Now, as MediaWiki use git, I decided to maintain my instance with the git repository and extensions as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a documentation on that :
 Installation method Core + extensions Upgrade core + extensions  &amp;nbsp;
I hope this will help some of you that still manage it by the old way.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve updated them to recover the compatibility on MediaWiki with the latest version. You can find updated version here :

After a few searches, I found pkg2ng :-). That&amp;rsquo;s THE tool for FreeBSD. But unfortunately, as written in the wiki :
 As a consequence of the security incident on 11th November 2012, for the time being pre-compiled packages for pkgng are not available from any official FreeBSD repository.</description>

      <description>Selfoss is a self-hosted RSS reader solution. It could be compared to Tiny Tiny RSS or Feedly.
I liked to test that nice solution. But I&amp;rsquo;m still staying with Fever, as there is no Android version working with Selfoss (only an old one exist, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t work) and the web interface is a little bit slow (compared to Fever). I hope this will be better in a short term as this is the most elegant Open Source version I&amp;rsquo;ve tested for now.</description>

      <description>Beamer is a stable solution to make beautiful presentations with LateX. I recently used it and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
It&amp;rsquo;s the power of LateX with elegant presentations. The first time I saw it, was at FOSDEM this year (2013) and was surprised by the presentation quality.
Handling is a little bit long at first, but once done, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to think of what your slides should look and only need to concentrate on the content.</description>

Anyway even with new interface and features on iOS 7, there are still remaining work in comparison of Android. And what about new Apple features ?&amp;hellip; Not really relevant one :-(
I&amp;rsquo;ll test it later on my iPad but I&amp;rsquo;m still frustrated even if it&amp;rsquo;s better than the latests keynotes.</description>

The first time I tried, I was on a 2.x version of Android and a lot of missing features didn&amp;rsquo;t helped me to switch. My cell phone was a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I really can&amp;rsquo;t stand on Samsung Touchwizz layer. That why I decided to install a Mod called Cyanogen (you&amp;rsquo;ve certainly already have heard of this).</description>

In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ve modified my awesome configuration to get special music keys to work like a charm :-)</description>

For several months, I thinked to change my current one, but none really exited me. But this one is really, really cool. The touch feeling is really fine, additional button are nice (more would be great as well&amp;hellip;but it&amp;rsquo;s ok) and the must : input and output sound are directly on the keyboard, without any additional cables (all through USB :-)).</description>

      <description>Like in most of programming languages, even if it&amp;rsquo;s not a compiled one, there is always a solution to make binaries from your sources. To make is quick and easy I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little documentation on it. It&amp;rsquo;s in french sorry, but you should be able to understand even if you don&amp;rsquo;t speak french (or use the translate plugin in the left bar).
Documentation is here.</description>

      <description>Integrit is a simple yet secure alternative to products like tripwire. It has a small memory footprint, uses up-to-date cryptographic algorithms, and has features that make sense (like including the MD5 checksum of newly generated databases in the report.
You may already now the alternatives on OpenBSD or RedHat. So now let&amp;rsquo;s play with Debian :-)</description>

      <description>When you manage outgoing emails through SMTP, you may sometimes need to test if a service is able to send correctly emails and itself check that there were no issue during sending. You can create a black hole for a specific domain and Postfix will answer from the same manner as if it is ok. It also permit to test Postfix sending capacities on a server.

      <description>In a sad scenario where an application is fully consuming CPU to limit it. To do so, you will need a magic command called Cpulimit that will help you to limit a PID to a desired percentage usage of your CPU.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little documentation on cpulimit.</description>

      <description>Nginx Substitutions Filter is a filter module able to do both regular expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This module is quite different from the Nginx&amp;rsquo;s native Substitution Module. It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just like Apache&amp;rsquo;s mod_substitute.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played with the classic substitution module but due to limitations (only one matching pattern and no regex), it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to do all I wanted to do.</description>

      <description>It´s been a while that I was waiting for a tool that tells me if my Debian server is requesting a reboot or not. Of course GUI tools exists (like Ubuntu update-manager), but on a server machine, where there is no X server installed (thankfuly), this kind of CLI tools can be quickly interesting.
That´s why I wrote a tool called deb_reboot that gives the reboot requierement information in parsing postinstall scripts of installed packages.</description>

      <description>How could this happen ? I found a communication on that and it has simply been removed as there were no updates since a long time. Even if CVE were recently proposed, it&amp;rsquo;s considered as not enough :
http://debian.2.n7.nabble.com/Status-of-haproxy-for-upcoming-wheezy-release-td2907665.html
But guys ! Seriously, do you know how many people are using HAproxy ? It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that it&amp;rsquo;s not in the current stable version of Debian. Now let&amp;rsquo;s check the availability on all Debian versions, it&amp;rsquo;s currently only on oldstable and experimental versions :</description>

      <description>I was searching a way to minify my CSS. For those who don’t know what it is, it’s a method to win space for your CSS as it will remove all unneeded blank spaces and lines return. A lot of websites exists to minify your CSS, but if your website is not online and only running locally, you won’t be able to minimize it.
I found a little software written in Python, that makes it easy, called mincss (thanks to Peter Bengtsson for it).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been running it since a few months on it (on my servers and as a desktop) and I congratulate Debian team for their work ! In the upcoming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll try to start getting involved in some Debian&amp;rsquo;s packaging projects. My problem is : how many time do I have to give ?
One of my first taks, will be to integrate MySecureShell in the officials Debian repositories.</description>

Je vous en avait déjà parlé il y a quelques temps. Allez&amp;hellip;un petit refresh pour ceux qui ont oubliés : c&amp;rsquo;est un fork de MySQL, fait par l&amp;rsquo;auteur de MySQL.
MariaDB prends aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de plus en plus d’essor et nous propose depuis un petit moment maintenant sa solution cluster à base de Galera (qui fonctionne aussi sous MySQL).</description>

Depuis le temps que j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;ancienne et vu qu&amp;rsquo;elle tourne en permanence, je trouve que c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment du bon matos ! Du coup pour remplacer celle ci, je me suis prit la 6501-70 avec Atom 1,6Ghz, 2 Go de RAM et SSD Intel 30G.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques semaines, je discutais avec un collègue de NetBSD. Il me racontait ses bonnes expériences avec cet OS. Vu que ça faisait un moment que je voulais essayé, je me suis lancé et ai changé l&amp;rsquo;OS de ma Soekris de FreeBSD à NetBSD. De plus, iMil n&amp;rsquo;arrête pas d&amp;rsquo;en parler et ça m&amp;rsquo;a donc fortement chatouillé.
L&amp;rsquo;installeur est sympatoche, le coup du pkgin à la fin c&amp;rsquo;est top (bien qu&amp;rsquo;un peu de simplification pour les néophytes serait pas mal) et les VirtIO intégrés, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment bien joué.</description>

      <description>Voici une interface web plutôt bien fichue qui permet de vous gérer vos serveurs Bind. Son nom est NamedManager. Elle sait aussi bien gérer des trucs classique, que des choses un peu plus poussée (la gestion automatique des PTR, le renseignement automatique un subnet, le multi serveurs&amp;hellip;) et en plus elle est élégante !
Je vous ai fait une doc pour sa mise en place qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&amp;rsquo;on pourrait l&amp;rsquo;imaginer.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, c&amp;rsquo;est une très bonne nouvelle qui vient de tomber ! SkySQL rachète MariaDB. Les boites frileuses de passer sous MariaDB, sous prétexte qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas de boites derrière, vont pouvoir être rassurer et y aller pour de la production. C&amp;rsquo;est donc une excellente nouvelle pour MariaDB dont certains moteurs passent en OpenSource comme tokudb par exemple.
Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;à terme, un bon paquet de distributions, tel que Mageia (cc Kharec), vont switcher sur MariaDB et abandonner définitivement MySQL.</description>

Superbe formation, surtout lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on voit ce que LdemonLDAP est capable d&amp;rsquo;apporter en terme de fonctionnalités par rapports à d&amp;rsquo;autres SSO. De plus son architecture et son mode de fonctionnement est très bien pensé.
Bref, un des hits aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui ! Seul petit b mol pour le moment, il n&amp;rsquo;est compatible qu&amp;rsquo;avec Apache. Si vous êtes un aficionados de Lighty ou Nginx, passez votre chemin.</description>

      <description>Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, à Linagora, je travaille dans une équipe de support dont je suis le leader technique. Seulement voilà, mes gars ne connaissent pas de solutions de reporting de machine. Du coup, lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on a un client chez qui on doit récupérer des données d&amp;rsquo;une machine de prod, il est bien pratique d&amp;rsquo;avoir toutes les données d&amp;rsquo;un coup et éviter les aller/retour avec celui ci.
Dans mon ancienne boite, j&amp;rsquo;utilisais pas mal le support RedHat et le sosreport est quelque chose que j&amp;rsquo;ai pas mal utilisé.</description>

      <description>Cela fait un moment que je me pose la question de mettre le blog et mes articles du wiki en anglais. Cela permettrait de toucher un peu plus de monde, mais aussi d&amp;rsquo;en écarter malheureusement certains :-(
Je vous rassure, je ne vais pas faire une conversion de ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, mais je souhaiterais écrire les prochains articles blog et wiki en anglais. Faire les 2 en parallèle ne serait pas faisable compte tenu du temps que cela me prendrait.</description>

      <description>Ahhhhh, je crois que je vais enfin pouvoir me poser un moment ! J&amp;rsquo;ai enfin trouvé mon environnement de bureau pour être productif, ça s&amp;rsquo;appelle Awesome et comme son nom l&amp;rsquo;indique ça l&amp;rsquo;est ! Je tourne donc depuis 2 mois maintenant sous Awesome et suis ravis du résultat. C&amp;rsquo;est stable, très léger, embarque plusieurs mode de tilling est prévu pour le mouseless et dépourvu de toutes fioritures inutiles comme on peut trouver sous Ubuntu.</description>

      <title>Forcer un shell lors de logins LDAP</title>
      <link>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2013/04/04/forcer-un-shell-lors-de-logins-ldap/</link>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment aidé un ancien collègue qui avait besoin d&amp;rsquo;une solution pour forcer des utilisateurs ayant déjà un shell LDAP à avoir un shell plus restreint de type lshell. La problématique est que si l&amp;rsquo;on change le shell au niveau LDAP, il faudra alors utiliser ce shell sur toutes les machines. Ce n&amp;rsquo;est donc tout simplement pas envisageable.
Par contre, il est possible de modifier les propriétés NSS lors du login :-).</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai en ce moment besoin d&amp;rsquo;installer beaucoup de machines, donc j&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour le preseed que j&amp;rsquo;avais pour Squeeze et ai complété un peu plus ma documentation. Rien de bien sorcier, c&amp;rsquo;est juste ultra pratique de rien avoir à rentrer pour l&amp;rsquo;installation d&amp;rsquo;une machine et laisser la gestion du reste à Puppet par exemple.
Pour ceux qui veulent voir à quoi ça ressemble&amp;hellip;ça se passe ici.
J&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour le mettre également sur mon git.</description>

      <description>Si vous voulez tester OpenStack sans vous fatiguer, il existe un projet baptisé DevStack. C&amp;rsquo;est un simple script shell qui va vous construire une machine avec tous les composants nécessaire pour pouvoir tester et développer sur un environnement OpenStack.
Et ce qui est bien, c&amp;rsquo;est de pouvoir faire du Qemu dans du KVM. Bon attention aux performances et aux bugs quand même, je vous rappelle que c&amp;rsquo;est du test et que ça s&amp;rsquo;appuie sur la version actuelle du repository.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques années, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà fait un upgrade de mon Mac Mini qui me sert aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de serveur.
Maintenant, je commence a avoir de nouveaux besoins, nécessitant de plus en plus de ressources. J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà quelques problèmes d&amp;rsquo;I/O, ce qui m&amp;rsquo;a pousser à prendre un SSD et un besoin de plus des 4 Gb de mémoire installés. En parcourant la documentation de mon Mac mini, la taille maximale annoncée est de 4Gb.</description>

      <description>Et voilà encore une migration de faite. Elle s&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien passée, alors que c&amp;rsquo;était mal partie. En effet, il a fallut que je change la configuration de mon Nginx pour que cette nouvelle mouture fonctionne. Ces informations n&amp;rsquo;étant pas marquées dans la documentation officielle, j&amp;rsquo;ai perdu un peu de temps en pensant que ma migration avait foirée.
En montant une autre plateforme from scratch, j&amp;rsquo;avais le même problème. Le soucis était alors rapidement identifiable.</description>

MediaWiki est un logiciel libre orienté serveur, disponible sous Licence publique générale GNU (GNU General Public License – GPL). Il est conçu pour fonctionner dans une ferme composée d’un bon nombre de serveurs appartenant à un site web qui peut avoir plusieurs millions de clics par jour. MediaWiki est un logiciel extrêmement puissant, adaptable à souhait et permettant une implémentation de wiki aux fonctionnalités riches.</description>

Dans le même esprit (mais plus orienté développement), on a l&amp;rsquo;ancien et vénérable Bugzilla qui fonctionne parfaitement et est utilisé encore aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui par de nombreuses sociétés ou pour des projets communautaires.
Je vous ai fait une petite documentation sur la mise en place de Bugzilla car j&amp;rsquo;ai du en installer une récemment. Si vous avez envie de jouer un peu avec, c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;occasion :-)</description>

      <description>KVM, quel merveilleux hyperviseur ! Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise depuis plusieurs années sur mes serveurs et je commence a l&amp;rsquo;utiliser sur ma workstation pour plusieurs raisons. Je vais comparer KVM a l&amp;rsquo;outil de virtualisation gratuit, a la mode : VirtualBox. Voici les raisons qui me poussent a passer a KVM :
 La licence : VirtualBox c&amp;rsquo;est bien, mais si je peux éviter toute dépendance avec Oracle, c&amp;rsquo;est mieux ! Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas envie de connaître a fond une techno propriétaire qui peut d&amp;rsquo;un jour a l&amp;rsquo;autre basculer de gratuite à payante (faut pas oublier que c&amp;rsquo;est Oracle hein !</description>

      <description>Une fois n&amp;rsquo;est pas coutume, j&amp;rsquo;ai acheté un logiciel. Certains rigoleront parce que c&amp;rsquo;est simplement pour gérer des flux RSS. Mais lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on dépasse les 300 flux utilisés, il est important d&amp;rsquo;avoir un outil performant et fonctionnel.
Il y a quelques jours, Google annonçait la date de fermeture du service Google Reader. Je me suis mis a chercher une alternative self-hosted ! Et a part Tiny-Tiny RSS qui manque de quelques fonctions indispensable, Leed qui ne possède pas d&amp;rsquo;application pour smartphone, le choix commençait a se rétrécir.</description>

      <description>Toi lecteur, si comme moi tu es un looser du design et que les sites web que tu créer ressemble a ceux du début de années 2000, alors bootstrap est fait pour toi !
Concrètement qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est ? Simplement une suite de CSS/JavaScripts/Images pour habiller ton site et en plus responsiveness. Et a mettre en place, c&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante.
Mais qui est l&amp;rsquo;âme charitable a avoir développé et publie ceci me diras tu ?</description>

      <description>Les SSD coûtent de moins en moins cher et leurs performances sont incroyables comparées a celles des disques classiques.
Pourtant, si on ne fait pas un peu de tuning pour les optimiser, on perd des performances (moins linéaires) avec le temps et on réduit surtout leurs durée de vie.
Récemment j&amp;rsquo;ai passé tous mes ordinateurs perso sous SSD et par chance au boulot j&amp;rsquo;ai pu être équipé d&amp;rsquo;une bête de course avec SSD également.</description>

      <description>Titre provocateur ? Oui, c&amp;rsquo;est vrai ! En même temps, Vmware se repose un peu sur ses lauriers et OpenStack prend de l’ampleur. Il fallait bien en match pour les départager.
Je suis récemment tombé sur ce match intéressant entre Vmware et OpenStack.
Mon avis personnel sur ce match est qu&amp;rsquo;il est très difficile de vraiment les départager. Tout dépends du besoin et de l&amp;rsquo;évolution de celui ci. Néanmoins, cet article est très intéressant car il cite les fonctionnalités majeures de chacun et les compares.</description>

Il est possible de faire mieux, plus classe et surtout : tout OS confondus (à condition que son navigateur supporte HTML 5 sur), ça s&amp;rsquo;appelle Impress.js !
Comment ? Regardez une démo d&amp;rsquo;Impress.js http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/
C&amp;rsquo;est donc en Javascript, c&amp;rsquo;est beau, simple à utiliser (quand on code un peu). Et pour les moins codeurs d&amp;rsquo;entre nous, voici un autre lien qui devrait vous plaire, c&amp;rsquo;est une interface pour Impress.</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est lors d&amp;rsquo;une formation accélérée dans ma boîte que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu découvrir a quel point Git est puissant. Pourtant j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression de n&amp;rsquo;en avoir toujours vu qu&amp;rsquo;une infime partie.

Cela faisait un moment que je pensais jouer avec ce produit et c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité enfantine. Il existe pleins de plugins permettant de faire pleins de choses variées. C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment plaisant. Sans parler de la partie cliente lourde bien faite et multi plateformes.
Si vous avez des retours d&amp;rsquo;expériences sur ce produit, je suis preneur.</description>

      <description>J’ai connu ce principe l’année dernière et j’en ai récemment entendu parler de nouveau. J’avais envie de vous faire partager ce principe car j’ai pu le constater plusieurs fois.
Je vous fais pars d&amp;rsquo;une partie de la définition de Wikipédia :
 Le Principe de Peter, également appelé « syndrome de la promotion Focus » de Laurence J. Peter et Raymond Hull, est un principe relatif à l&amp;rsquo;organisation hiérarchique. Il est paru originalement sous le titre The Peter Principle (1969)1.</description>

      <description>Ce type de code bar vous parle ? J&amp;rsquo;ai commencé à m&amp;rsquo;y intéresser il y a quelques temps déjà et ai décidé de creuser un peu la question ces derniers temps. Comme vous l&amp;rsquo;avez certainement constaté, j&amp;rsquo;ai maintenant un QR Code sur mon blog et mon wiki.
Pour ceux qui ne voient pas à quoi ça sert, tout simplement à être scanné via un téléphone portable par exemple pour donner des informations.</description>

      <description>Pour faire suite à mon précédent article sur le Raspberry Pi, j&amp;rsquo;en ai fait une station multimedia en utilisant OpenElec.
OpenElec est une distribution GNU/Linux embarquée ayant pour but de permettre l’utilisation d’un centre multimédia (media center).
Voici un article pour mettre tout ceci en place, c&amp;rsquo;est très facile et fonctionne parfaitement.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai commandé et reçu en moins d&amp;rsquo;une semaine un Raspberry Pi B (512Mb de RAM).
C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment un beau jouet et le rapport qualité prix est vraiment très bon !
Le petit point négatif que j&amp;rsquo;aurais a dire est l&amp;rsquo;absence de bouton power. Du fait que le courant soit délivré par USB, ce matériel fonctionne comme n&amp;rsquo;importe quel périphérique USB, c&amp;rsquo;est a dire allumé lorsqu&amp;rsquo;il est branché et éteint, débranché. Certains diront qu&amp;rsquo;il faut le laisser en permanence branché vu sa faible consommation (~3-3,5W), mais je ne suis pas de cet avis.</description>

      <description>Le titre de l&amp;rsquo;article en dit long. Depuis que je suis passé à Nginx, c&amp;rsquo;est vrai, c&amp;rsquo;est le jour et la nuit comparé à Apache. J&amp;rsquo;en suis extrêmement satisfait ! Cependant, malgré la gestion du cache via Nginx, les performances ne sont pas aussi bonnes qu&amp;rsquo;attendues.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc testé Nginx avec Varnish, histoire de me refaire une opinion et effectivement Varnish fait vraiment la différence, non seulement côté temps de réponse, mais surtout côté CPU !</description>

      <description>Avant d&amp;rsquo;attaquer le 2 ème jour, je vais finir sur le premier (la suite d&amp;rsquo;hier).
Un des supers sujet était Bind 10 que j&amp;rsquo;attendais avec impatience. Il n&amp;rsquo;y a malheureusement eu d&amp;rsquo;informations sur les nouveautés aidant a la HA. Cependant il a été totalement réécrit pour supporter + de 100 cores alors qu&amp;rsquo;aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui au delà de 6, il y a des problèmes de performances. On a également (et étrangement) un serveur DHCP qui est intégré a Bind.</description>

Au menu une petite intro Ubuntu sur Juju et MASS mais piètre qualité du représentant de Canonical. Quelque chose a retenir cependant, il faut vraiment tester Ceph :
Heureusement qu&amp;rsquo;il y a eu une magnifique représentation MediaWiki avec du Jenkins, PhantomJS (incroyable) et d&amp;rsquo;autres produits dont Cucumber (qui est très impressionnant). Le mec de Wikipedia/MediaWiki avait vraiment l&amp;rsquo;air de bien connaître son sujet c&amp;rsquo;était top :</description>

Bref, voici une solution pour supprimer l&amp;rsquo;onglet &amp;ldquo;Discussion&amp;rdquo; de toutes les pages. C&amp;rsquo;est un Hook pour Mediawiki disponible ici.</description>

      <description>Jenkins est un outil open source d&amp;rsquo;intégration continue, fork de l&amp;rsquo;outil Hudson après les différends entre son auteur, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, et Oracle. Écrit en Java, Jenkins fonctionne dans un conteneur de servlets tel qu’Apache Tomcat, ou en mode autonome avec son propre serveur Web embarqué.
Dans le cadre de l&amp;rsquo;amélioration de Limesurvey comme cité dans un précédent ticket, le couplage Selenium/Jenkins est très pratique. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais une documentation sur la mise en place de Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Dans le cadre d&amp;rsquo;amélioration des produits Open Source, je travaille avec un collègue en relation avec le créateur de LimeSurvey pour fournir une plateforme de test de non régression qui sera généreusement prêtée par Linagora.
Dans ce cadre, nous utilisons l&amp;rsquo;outil Selenium pour tester l&amp;rsquo;interface graphique car nous avons régulièrement observé des régressions sur ce produit. Selenium est donc très pratique et surtout d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante !
J&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même fait une documentation sur Selenium pour ceux que ça intéresse.</description>

      <description>Qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est bien Git ! Un peu complexe mais tellement puissant.
Bref comme vous le savez maintenant, la nouvelle version de l&amp;rsquo;extension DeleteHistory est sortie. Et la méthode d&amp;rsquo;installation a la mode de Mediawiki est d&amp;rsquo;utiliser directement git et non plus l&amp;rsquo;outil de téléchargement du site Mediawiki.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc voulu suivre le move et créer des repository dédiés a mes extensions Mediawiki tout en gardant l&amp;rsquo;historique de mon ancien repository.</description>

Voici la version 0.5 de DeleteHistory avec quelques petites nouveautés lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on demande une optimisation des tables MySQL :
 L&amp;rsquo;ajout du moteur utilisé pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la collation utilisée pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la traduction en Allemand  Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas grand chose, mais ça aide grandement a voir pourquoi certaines tables ne sont pas optimisées.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera ceux qui souhaitent passer la certif. Évidement ces questions ne sont qu&amp;rsquo;une mince partie de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il faut savoir pour cette certif, mais elles permettent toutefois de valider votre niveau et vous entraîner a passer la 101.</description>

Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que les gars de chez Debian estiment que Suhoshin devrait être intégré mainstream dans le code de PHP et que ça ne devrait pas être aux distribution de les packager.</description>

Alors voilà, je suis passé à Nginx et après plusieurs jours dessus, je suis globalement satisfait. Petit bémol pour le stockage des éléments statiques qui n&amp;rsquo;est visiblement pas faisable sans passer par du proxy_pass. J&amp;rsquo;ai pu observer une gestion du cache globale moins efficace avec Nginx qu&amp;rsquo;avec Varnish.</description>

Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas encore, configurer Gmail comme si c&amp;rsquo;était un serveur exchange sur leurs iPhone va bientôt ne plus fonctionner. Le service ferme ses portes pour les comptes gratuits fin janvier.
Google fait ça pour 2 raisons :
 La licence a payer a Microsoft pour utiliser ActiveSync. Parce que Microsoft n&amp;rsquo;a toujours pas ouvert les standards libre sur ces terminaux.  Pour se passer d&amp;rsquo;Exchange sur son iPhone et le configurer pour avoir l&amp;rsquo;équivalence des services, voici comment faire&amp;hellip;</description>

Déjà pour commencer&amp;hellip;qui utilise cette méthode ?
 OpenStack : https://review.openstack.org MediaWiki : https://lwn.net/Articles/480002/  Plutôt des gens qui ont de grosses infrastructures donc. Mais concrètement en quoi ça consiste ? Beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;articles existent en anglais sur le net et abordent le sujet, mais je n&amp;rsquo;en ai pas vraiment trouvé qui parlaient de comment mettre en place ce genre de méthodes et avec quels outils.</description>

      <description>PuppetDB permet de récupérer les données collectées par Puppet comme les facts et d’utiliser entre autres les ressources exportées. Ces données pourront ensuite être utilisées par d’autres programmes, comme le dashboard, ou vos propres outils grâce à une API.
Il est donc utile de mettre en place ce genre de solution quand on commence à avoir un parc d&amp;rsquo;une centaine de machines ou une configuration assez conséquente.
Voici la doc de PuppetDB pour en mettre un rapidement en place.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour la documentation que j&amp;rsquo;avais fait de Puppet 2.7 en version 3.0.
Mis à part les gains de perfs qui ne changent rien a la configuration, j&amp;rsquo;ai rajouté :
 Passenger : qui est l&amp;rsquo;officiel remplaçant du couple Mongrel/Nginx L&amp;rsquo;installation : celle ci se fait très simplement en installant un package deb ou rpm qui va installer le repository ainsi que la clé GPG associée La syntaxe : bien qu&amp;rsquo;elle change un peu, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas eu à retoucher mes modules du fait que je l&amp;rsquo;avais créer avec Gepetto et que ce plugin éclipse m&amp;rsquo;avait aider à écrire correctement tout mon code Puppet Gestion des certificat : puppetca a été mergé dans la commande puppet (comme beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;autres) et s&amp;rsquo;appelle avec les mêmes arguments qu&amp;rsquo;avant via &amp;lsquo;puppet cert&amp;rsquo; Puppetd : celui ci a aussi merger dans puppet et s&amp;rsquo;appelle maintenant via &amp;lsquo;puppet server&amp;rsquo; ou &amp;lsquo;puppet&amp;rsquo; suivant les cas d&amp;rsquo;usage.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment passé mon Mediawiki en 1.20. J&amp;rsquo;ai eu quelques petits soucis avec l&amp;rsquo;URL rewriting et les short URL. En effet, dans cette nouvelle version, ils ont supprimé le $wgUsePathInfo qui a du coup complètement cassé mes redirections.
J&amp;rsquo;ai finalement réussi à retrouver mon URL short mais d&amp;rsquo;une autre manière que je vous partage ici.

      <description>Toujours dans mes articles sur Tomcat, en voici un qui touche au clustering. Que l&amp;rsquo;on soit bien d&amp;rsquo;accord, le clustering Tomcat, c&amp;rsquo;est pas du failover avec un cluster applicatif externe. C&amp;rsquo;est une méthode interne à Tomcat permettant de synchroniser des sessions (et pas que).
Je vous ai fais une petite documentation pour une mise en place éclair de ce genre de solution.</description>

Dans l&amp;rsquo;une des dernières updates de Jetpack, il y a l&amp;rsquo;infinite scrolling que je souhaitais activer. Malheureusement, pour le thème que j&amp;rsquo;utilise (Yoko)&amp;hellip;impossible de l&amp;rsquo;activer, il n&amp;rsquo;est pas supporté :-(.

Synergy vous permet de partager facilement votre souris et votre clavier entre plusieurs ordinateurs. Il est libre et Open Source.

Il existe pour cela 2 manières :

J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà observé ceci sur les Red Hat 6.3 et viens de le constater également sur une Debian 6.

      <description>NoSQL signifie “Not Only SQL”, littéralement “pas seulement SQL”. Ce terme désigne l’ensemble des bases de données qui s’opposent à la notion relationnelle des SGBDR. La définition, “pas seulement SQL”, apporte un début de réponse à la question “Est ce que le NoSQL va tuer les bases relationnelles?”. En effet, NoSQL ne vient pas remplacer les BD relationnelles mais proposer une alternative ou compléter les fonctionnalités des SGBDR pour donner des solutions plus intéressantes dans certains contextes.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai cherché le moyen le plus simple de faire une faire attendre les gens lors d&amp;rsquo;un submit en PHP/HTML. Je suis tombé sur des trucs en Javascript qui n&amp;rsquo;étaient pas terrible, en Ajax compliqué à mettre en œuvre ou en jQuery avec des kilomètres de lignes. Puis je suis tombé sur cette solution, qui avec un simple div et innerHTML permettait de répondre à mon besoin.
Ok, est moche, mais je n&amp;rsquo;ai besoin d&amp;rsquo;aucune librairie en plus et c&amp;rsquo;est extrêmement simple à mettre en place et peu coûteux en lignes de code.</description>

      <title>Mediawiki : Cacher la sidebar</title>

      <description>Avec l&amp;rsquo;apparition des Notebook et portables de plus en plus petits avec des résolutions assez faible, il peut être vite pénible de faire du Mediawiki sur ce genre de matériels. C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai planché un peu sur le sujet et j&amp;rsquo;ai finalement trouver une solution pour cacher la sidebar lorsqu&amp;rsquo;un utilisateur connecté fait des modifications. On gagne du coup pas mal de place !
J&amp;rsquo;en ai profité également pour ajouter un onglet pour ajouter un fichier plus rapidement lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on a la sidebar cachée.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques temps, j&amp;rsquo;avais parlé d&amp;rsquo;optimisations du blog et wiki. Dans les commentaires, j&amp;rsquo;avais échangé oloncle et il m&amp;rsquo;a fait découvrir php-fpm. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais une petite documentation pour sa mise en place.
J&amp;rsquo;ai fais quelques recherches également sur le net pour voir des benchs entre varnish et le cache nginx. Il apparait qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a qu&amp;rsquo;environ 5% de performances de différence en faveur de Varnish, mais qu&amp;rsquo;il y a une plus grosse utilisation du CPU pour ce dernier.</description>

      <description>La dernière Freebox est pilotable par API. Pour quoi faire me direz vous ? Pour ma part, je l&amp;rsquo;utilise pour déconnecter un disque USB branché sur la Freebox server. En effet, pas moyen de le déconnecter sans se connecter à l&amp;rsquo;interface ou jouer pas mal avec la zapette. Bref, pas cool quant on est pressé.
Du coup, je me suis dis que j&amp;rsquo;allais regarder ce qui se faisait comme API et je suis tombé sur celle ci.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai longtemps utilisé cet outil trouvé sur le net, puis repris conjointement avec un ex collègue qui permet de recevoir un email en fonction d&amp;rsquo;alertes de Nagios. Nous l&amp;rsquo;utilisions pour recevoir, avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver au taf ces emails, pour savoir quels sont les problèmes avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver. Cela permet d&amp;rsquo;arriver soit en courant, soit serein :-)
C&amp;rsquo;est un script qui va parser l&amp;rsquo;interface web graphique de Nagios, récupérer le minimum d&amp;rsquo;informations pour un bon affichage sur smartphone et envoyer un mail.</description>

      <description>Je trouve qu&amp;rsquo;il ne manque pas grand chose à Sabnzbd pour qu&amp;rsquo;il soit parfait. Cependant certaines options manquent et heureusement l&amp;rsquo;API est là pour compenser. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris un script en python permettant de jouer avec l&amp;rsquo;API que délivre Sabnzbd. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai créer dans l&amp;rsquo;idée qu&amp;rsquo;il soit facile de rajouter une fonctionnalité via l&amp;rsquo;API. Ce script permet :
 De voir les éléments que fournit l&amp;rsquo;API XML De supprimer un certain nombre d&amp;rsquo;éléments dans l&amp;rsquo;historique  J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera certains à se plonger dedans, améliorer mon script ou bien utiliser les fonctions déjà existantes.</description>

      <description>Un ami m&amp;rsquo;a récemment prêté sa GoPro pour faire joujou. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai utilisée un peu violemment (c&amp;rsquo;est à dire que la vitesse avec les accoups violent c&amp;rsquo;est pas son truc à première vue) et la video faite ne s&amp;rsquo;est pas terminée correctement (illisible via VLC pour vous donner le niveau).
Après quelques recherches sur le net, j&amp;rsquo;ai fini par tomber sur des posts intéressant pour réparer des videos en MP4. La solution que j&amp;rsquo;ai trouvée fonctionne mais sans le son, qui à l&amp;rsquo;air plus compliqué à récupérer que la vidéo.</description>

Je me suis dis : &amp;ldquo;Bon un Nas, ça serait pas mal quand même, mais ça fait cher pour l&amp;rsquo;utilité que je souhaites !&amp;rdquo;.

Si vos connaissances en programmation sont en plus limitées, je vous conseil fortement ce livre sur Perl. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai lu il y a des années et c&amp;rsquo;est aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui grâce à lui que j&amp;rsquo;ai de bonnes bases.</description>

      <description>Si comme moi vous avez un tunnel à maintenir en permanence, qu&amp;rsquo;en cas de déconnexion vous souhaitez une reconnexion automatique, il vous faut utiliser alors un outil tel que AutoSSH.
Allez voici la doc pour mettre rapidement ça en place pour ceux que ça intéresse.</description>

      <description>Vous vous rappelez peut être de mon fameux Puppet Push qui me permettait d&amp;rsquo;exécuter des puppet client sur des hosts choisis.
Mcollective fait la même chose, mais en mieux et propose pleins de fonctionnalités en plus. Bref, il vous permet de contrôler tout un tas de machines très facilement et s&amp;rsquo;intègre très bien à Puppet. C&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;ailleurs aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui ce que j&amp;rsquo;utilise en production. Plutôt qu&amp;rsquo;un long discourt, je vous laisse voir ma doc sur Mcollective.</description>

      <description>Je sais que beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;entre vous auront déjà vu maintes et maintes fois ce genre de doc, mais sur le net je n&amp;rsquo;ai trouvé que des choses vieilles ou obsolète. Il a fallu fouiller pas mal pour trouver des infos plus ou moins à jour et jongler entre elles pour ce rendre compte vraiment de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il faut faire pour s&amp;rsquo;en sortir proprement.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais une doc qui en 5 min vous permettra de faire des packages Red Hat.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai fais un article sur les performances d&amp;rsquo;un système ou plutôt sur les files d&amp;rsquo;attente. C&amp;rsquo;est théorique et basé sur la loi de Little. Pour ceux que ça intéresse, suivez le lien. Cet article vous aidera a comprendre comment il est possible de se retrouver avec de mauvaises performances sur un système et comment s&amp;rsquo;en prémunir. Je suis content de pouvoir vous publier cet article car ça faisait des mois que je l&amp;rsquo;avais commencer.</description>

      <description>Google frappe encore avec un autre module pour Apache. Vous connaissez certainement Page Speed, l&amp;rsquo;extension pour Firefox qui vous dit ce qui pourrait être améliorer pour optimiser les temps de chargements de votre site. Certains points sont délicats à mettre en place, alors Google a fait un module pour Apache (mod_pagespeed) qui permet de couvrir une partie de ces optimisations. De base, beaucoup de choses sont activées et on voit la différences sur les sites non optimisés.</description>

      <description>TinyProxy est un proxy, tout comme Squid, mais qui se veut être léger. Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise au travail sur ma machine pour mettre toutes mes applications dessus. L&amp;rsquo;avantage est d&amp;rsquo;avoir la configuration du proxy pour wget, apt, etc&amp;hellip; qui pointe en localhost. Ainsi dans la configuration de TinyProxy, il n&amp;rsquo;y a plus qu&amp;rsquo;à configurer le serveur Proxy sur lequel on veut taper pour que toute mes applications soient redirigées dessus sans avoir à les toucher au moindre changement :-)</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai commencé à lire ce livre après avoir repensé toute ma conf puppet et c&amp;rsquo;est un peu dommage, j&amp;rsquo;aurais gagné du temps sur certaines choses. Bref ce livre s&amp;rsquo;adresse aux personnes ayant déjà fait du Puppet (normal c&amp;rsquo;est un cookbook), qui veulent automatiser au maximum. Voyez ce bouquin comme un retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience avec les best practices à adopter pour faire une bonne conf Puppet.
Pour vous donner un exemple, ce sera aussi mon retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience, j&amp;rsquo;ai utilisé Puppet pendant 2 ans et demie avec les fonctionnalités classiques et légèrement poussées.</description>

      <description>Voici le troisième et dernier article sur Puppet, nous allons parler des modules. C&amp;rsquo;est là dessus qu&amp;rsquo;on passe un temps fou pour arriver à ce que tout soit automatisé. Pour certains d&amp;rsquo;entre eux, je n&amp;rsquo;ai passé que quelques minutes et d&amp;rsquo;autres plusieurs jours. J&amp;rsquo;ai tenté d&amp;rsquo;expliquer chaque module avec les points les plus intéressants, les choses les plus pertinentes pour la compréhension et la découverte de certaines fonctionnalités.
C&amp;rsquo;est avec beaucoup de recul et plusieurs années d&amp;rsquo;expériences dans Puppet que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu arriver à avoir une certaine vision de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il est possible de faire et ai donc passé en revue tous mes modules.</description>

      <description>Toujours dans la lignée de l&amp;rsquo;article sur Puppet (voir articles précédents), je vous propose cette fois ci un deuxième article, qui contient des astuces et des cas d&amp;rsquo;utilisation du langage. Que ce soit pour les manifests, les templates, facter, parser etc&amp;hellip;
Pour ceux qui se sont arrêter aux manifests et ont trouvé des limitations ou tout simplement ne se sont pas encore posée la question de savoir ce que l&amp;rsquo;on pouvait bien faire de plus que les ressources de base, je vous conseil d&amp;rsquo;aller voir, vous risquez d&amp;rsquo;être surpris par la puissance de Puppet :-)</description>

Sérieusement, je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi Solaris et maintenant Red Hat nous poussent à ce que les interfaces réseaux possèdent le nom court du chipset des cartes. C&amp;rsquo;est tellement chiant lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaite gérer un parc informatique de manière automatisée.

Etant donné que la première version stable du BTRFS est sortie, je me suis dis qu&amp;rsquo;il était temps de faire un article là dessus.

Ils ont visiblement décidé d&amp;rsquo;arrêter car la plus part des gens utilisent le web mail.
Je suis vraiment déçu.
J&amp;rsquo;espère sincèrement qu&amp;rsquo;un fork va voir le jour et que le produit va continuer à vivre.
D&amp;rsquo;après les dernières news que l&amp;rsquo;on peut voir sur le net, il semblerait que Mozilla va se concentrer d&amp;rsquo;avantage sur la stabilité du produit que ses évolutions.</description>

 Utilisation des VMs en NAT Une configuration iptables pour passer le NAT Ajouter des disques à chaud Dédier des CPU à une VM  J&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis à jour la documentation sur KVM avec les fonctionnalités citées ci dessus.</description>

      <description>Pour les plus gamers d&amp;rsquo;entre vous, vous aurez sans doutes reconnu ce jeu de mot minable entre le jeu dispo sur l&amp;rsquo;App Store appelé &amp;lsquo;Slice it !&amp;rsquo; et les slices de l&amp;rsquo;UFS. Bref, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite doc pour l&amp;rsquo;utilisation d&amp;rsquo;UFS sur FreeBSD et surtout le management des slices sur une partition FreeBayEsseDay.

      <description>La gestion des groupes de packages dans les kickstart c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment relou quant on tombe pas sur une doc claire. J&amp;rsquo;ai perdu un peu de temps dessus donc j&amp;rsquo;ai rajouté dans la doc initiale ces informations pour qu&amp;rsquo;en 2 sec vous puissiez déterminer le nom d&amp;rsquo;un groupe de packages à utiliser dans le kickstart.

      <description>Bon ça y est, je commence à bien maitriser Python&amp;hellip;presque aussi bien que Perl. Tout comme l&amp;rsquo;introduction au Perl que j&amp;rsquo;avais fait il y a quelques temps, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais de même pour Python.
Si vous avez déjà quelques notions en Python, ça devrait aller. C&amp;rsquo;est plus un aide mémoire qu&amp;rsquo;un Tutoriel complet pour apprendre Python. Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a suffisament sur le net pour que je tombe dans ce genre de travers.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour une documentation sur Squid. Cette fois ci, la configuration se passe sur une FreeBSD et ai beaucoup plus détaillée (normal, je me suis tapé le man en entier) que la précédente. Il me reste encore quelques améliorations à faire, mais ça fera l&amp;rsquo;objet d&amp;rsquo;un futur post.

      <guid>https://deimosfr.github.io/blog/2012/05/27/poweradmin-une-interface-web-de-gestion-de-powerdns/</guid>
      <description>PowerAdmin est une interface d&amp;rsquo;administration pour PowerDNS. Elle est faite en PHP et permet de gérer bien plus que la majorité des fonctionnalités de base de PowerDNS.
Elle est très utile si vous avez un backend MySQL qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas très pratique pour ajouter des enregistrements/zones ou toucher à la configuration de PowerDNS.
Pour la mise en place de cette interface, c&amp;rsquo;est par ici.</description>

      <description>PowerDNS est (comme son nom l&amp;rsquo;indique) un serveur DNS. C&amp;rsquo;est un concurrent direct à Bind. Il se veut moins gourmand en RAM et offre une utilisation de configuration plus souple que Bind.
PowerDNS est découpé en plusieurs rôles :

      <description>Derrière ce titre pompeux se cache en fait la méthode pour activer le port série au démarrage d&amp;rsquo;une machine. Cette solution s&amp;rsquo;avère vite pratique lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites accéder à certaines machines qui ne répondent plus, ou bien via des solutions de virtualisation.
C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi je vous ai concocté :
 Une petite doc sur le port série sous Linux Une petite doc sur le port série sous FreeBSD Une mise à jour de la doc de KVM pour pouvoir y accéder cash (oui comme tabata)  &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>MediaWiki 1.19 est sorti il y a peu de temps et comme à chaque upgrade, c&amp;rsquo;est un bonheur, sauf lorsque vous faites des modifications de skins ou de code. Pour ma part, j&amp;rsquo;aime bien modifier les skins pour y insérer des Google Ads. Mais voilà, comme je viens de l&amp;rsquo;expliquer, a chaque update j&amp;rsquo;ai tout qui est déglingué.
Donc pour palier à ce problème, il existe une petite extension fort sympathique, qui permet d&amp;rsquo;insérer du code à certains endroits de vos skins MediaWiki.</description>

Alors ceci est fait pour toi !!! J&amp;rsquo;ai concocté un petit script (un peu sale oui je l&amp;rsquo;avoue, mais il a le mérite de bien fonctionner) que j&amp;rsquo;ai pomper sur une discussion Red Hat permettant donc de jouer avec les snapshot pour fsckiser (oui le verbe) à la volée tous les LV de type ext3 et 4 sur une machine !</description>

      <description>Jojo, mon expert MySQL (Joffrey de SkySQL pour ne pas le citer) me bassine depuis un moment à abandonner MySQL pour passer sur MariaDB.
Après quelques benchs qu&amp;rsquo;il a effectué, j&amp;rsquo;ai été bluffé et quant il m&amp;rsquo;a dit qu&amp;rsquo;en 5 min ça s&amp;rsquo;installait&amp;hellip;je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas perdu de temps. Donc le blog et le wiki tournent maintenant sur MariaDB :-)
Je vous conseil fortement de passer dessus, car au final, vous ne serrez pas perdu, vu que ce sont les mêmes commandes que MySQL (normal c&amp;rsquo;est un fork) et vous aurez de biens meilleures performances.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai également fait de la modification de code pour obtenir une interface minimale afin d&amp;rsquo;être optimisée pour des écrans dédiés au monitoring.
Suivez le guide :-)

      <description>Nagios c&amp;rsquo;est super, ça manque juste de fonctionnalités quelque fois. Alors voici un super addon de la mort qui permet d&amp;rsquo;extraire des données rapidement et de booster les possibilités (multisites, cluster&amp;hellip;).
Je n&amp;rsquo;aborde pas dans ce tuto toutes les facettes de ce soft tellement il y a de possibilités, je préfère laisser celà à la documentation officielle, mais plutôt un moyen de déployer rapidement cet outil et quelques exemples de prise en main rapide.</description>

      <description>Un pote m&amp;rsquo;a parlé il y a quelques temps de ce soft Sabnzbd. Je n&amp;rsquo;y avais pas spécialement prêter attention jusqu&amp;rsquo;à cette semaine. Il dispose d&amp;rsquo;une interface web simple, d&amp;rsquo;options de configuration très bien pensées&amp;hellip;
Le petit hic par rapport à URD que j&amp;rsquo;utilise aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui est le manque du multi utilisateur. A part ça, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment top et les applications tierces apportent à cet outil un super potentiel. Par exemple on peut gérer entièrement son serveur depuis le mobile, il y a des skins mobile&amp;hellip;</description>

Ni une, ni deux, j&amp;rsquo;ai mis ça en place sur le wiki et le blog. Donc si vous avez par hasard une subite envie de me faire un petit cadeau, n&amp;rsquo;hésitez pas :-p</description>

Si j&amp;rsquo;ai le temps et le courage, je la poursuivrais pour rentrer un peu dans les détails, mais le but n&amp;rsquo;est pas de réécrire la documentation officielle&amp;hellip;juste faire gagner du temps. Vous pouvez cette documentation sur Red Hat Satellite ici.</description>

Déjà, il faut savoir que même si t&amp;rsquo;es péter de tune, t&amp;rsquo;as beau t&amp;rsquo;acheter la Logitech la plus cher, elle ne fonctionnera pas avec la Playstation 3 ou bien la Freebox, pourquoi ?</description>

Et bien si et on peut en faire des choses dans ce /dev ! Je vous ai donc concocté une petite documentation sur ce merveilleux udev qui vous permettra de lancer des scripts au branchement d&amp;rsquo;un périphérique, de modifier le nom d&amp;rsquo;un device qui apparait dans /dev, de renomer /dev en /mes_periph_de_batard et moulte modifications de la muerta !</description>

La solution consiste donc à utiliser le filesystem tmpfs et rediriger ses fichiers temporaires dessus.

L&amp;rsquo;intérêt de proxychains est que la configuration ne se fait qu&amp;rsquo;une seule fois, dans son propre fichier de configuration.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite documentation dessus. Je vous conseil fortement de switcher, Tmux c&amp;rsquo;est géniale !</description>

Mon wiki quant a lui devient un peu compliqué pour avoir de beaux effets CSS3 kikoolol de la mort et ça devient pénible d’écrire 30 fois les mêmes trucs à rallonge.
Je suis donc tombé sur THE extension qui me simplifie la vie : CharInsert !
Comme à mon habitude, pour les plus curieux, voici la documentation.</description>

      <description>Solaris c&amp;rsquo;est bien, sur UFS, c&amp;rsquo;est tout de suite moins bien. J&amp;rsquo;ai eu besoin d&amp;rsquo;ajouter de la swap sur une partition, et quand on fait pas ça tous les 4 matins, se replonger dedans c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment très très chiant.
C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation pour créer du swap sur UFS/ZFS/Fichiers. J&amp;rsquo;en ai du coup profiter pour mettre à jour mes documentations sur :

Strace est utile mais pas user friendly à aborder. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite doc pour mieux comprendre comment il fonctionne et comment l&amp;rsquo;utiliser pour en tirer le meilleur.</description>

Personnellement, je trouve ça sexy, mais c&amp;rsquo;est une usine à gaz aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui pour faire ce genre de chose (à tel point qu&amp;rsquo;ils proposent une VM préconfigurée pour éviter la mise en place manuelle).</description>

J&amp;rsquo;aimerais bien dire : &amp;ldquo;En route vers RHCA maintenant !&amp;rdquo;, mais je dois avouer que la route va être longue, cher et parsemée d’embuches. Il va me falloir 5 autres certifs pour atteindre ce titre. Il y en a 2 que je pense avoir sans trop de difficultés (Cluter + Statellite) tandis que la RH442 (celle dont j&amp;rsquo;ai eu la formation cette semaine) me semble bien complexe.</description>

Même si je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas très bien connu Paolo, il m&amp;rsquo;a marqué. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré pour la première fois il y a plus de 5 ans, lorsque j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une formation chez Sysdream.</description>

 Bonjour,
j&amp;rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécier votre note concernant l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur Debian. Ca marche très bien, et je me demandais si vous aviez assez de recul vis à vis des tests que vous avez fait pour vous demander si l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur une debian en production était envisageable ou pas ?</description>

Je travaille actuellement sur un projet à mon taf dont je suis l&amp;rsquo;initiateur mais pas le développeur, qui est FenriSQL. C&amp;rsquo;est un outil qui va permettre d&amp;rsquo;avoir un démon pour gérer tous ses backups MySQL via Xtrabackups.
L&amp;rsquo;outil est en version beta, va s&amp;rsquo;apprêter à passer en rc. Une release du code devrait arriver très prochainement sur sourceforge.</description>

      <description>C&amp;rsquo;est un truc con, mais par défaut, Squid donne un peu trop d&amp;rsquo;informations lorsque quelqu&amp;rsquo;un le traverse pour accéder à un site.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc modifier la documentation sur Squid pour y ajouter ces 3 petites lignes : # Be more anonymous # That’s three pieces of information you may not want to give away: # - The host name of your proxy server # - The version of Squid it’s running # - The IP address of the system that’s making the request via the proxy forwarded_for off visible_hostname proxy.</description>

      <description>Cette semaine, j’ai eu des GROOOOOOOOSSES merdes avec une baie de disques. Une fois réparée, mon quorum cluster était injoignable, bien que pourtant présent en tant que LUN sur la baie de disques.
Donc quant mes noeuds du serveur se sont mis à booter, l&amp;rsquo;absence de quorum empêchait le cluster de monter et je n&amp;rsquo;avais donc pas la main sur mes machines.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc un cluster de 6 noeuds qui était en amnésie (youpi).</description>

      <description>Voilà une petite astuce bien pratique qui permet temporairement, ne pas avoir de zpool montés au démarrage.
C&amp;rsquo;est très pratique lorsque comme moi, vos noeuds reboot sans cesse pour des partitions flinguées. La documentation est ici.</description>

Sa contribution à l’informatique moderne a été considérable. Le langage C est un des langages de programmation les plus utilisés dans le monde et se trouve au cœur d’une pléthore de programmes.

      <description>Cela fait longtemps que je crypte mes données avec ENCFS et j’en suis très satisfait, même si les performances ne sont pas au rendez vous (fuse). Il existe Luks (celui qui a dit skywalker sort) qui est intégré au noyau et qui est bien plus performant. Je pense qu’il est tout aussi fiable (pas testé sur du long terme, mais natif à Red Hat).
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc concocté comme à mon habitude une petite documentation sur Luks.</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est rageant, surtout qu&amp;rsquo;on ne sait pas la ou on a merder, il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas de corrigé d&amp;rsquo;examen.

      <description>Round 2, Fight ! Steeves me tannant encore et me montrant les trucs super tip top que Chrome fait…bah j’ai eu envie de renter l’aventure. Et tout comme la première fois… grosse déception !
 Mon blog : Le CSS3 ne s&amp;rsquo;affiche pas correctement WordPress : Créez un article en mode visuel, mettez un lien sur un bout de texte, et tapez sur la touche Entrée pour passer à la ligne&amp;hellip;ça ne fonctionne pas visuellement et pourtant en mode HTML on visualise bien les sauts de ligne L&amp;rsquo;importation depuis Firefox des bookmarks, il a fallu passez par des exports et imports manuel pour éviter le crash de Chrome Firebug moins complet sur Chrome que sur Firefox   Bon, ça commence à faire beaucoup, je n&#39;ai pas envie de perdre trop de temps donc on va garder encore une fois Firefox qui est au dessus de Chrome en terme de stabilité.</description>

      <description>Cette semaine j’ai appris à faire du Python pour voir un peu ce que ça donne comme langage. C’est pas mal du tout, il y a plein de built-in assez sympas. Je n’ai pas encore eu le temps de mettre à jour la doc de mon wiki par rapport à mes acquis, mais j’espère pouvoir le faire très prochainement.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour faire un truc qui sous OpenVZ est super relou : les User Beancounters.</description>

      <description>Quelques jours / semaines après avoir migré d&amp;rsquo;iPhone (5 ans de bons et loyaux services) vers Android, et faisant suite à un ancien post, je vais essayer de faire un petit article plus constructif.
Pour rentrer dans le vif du sujet, ceux qui attendent la réponse à : Est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;iPhone ou l&amp;rsquo;Android qui est le mieux ?
La réponse est simple : Il n&amp;rsquo;y en a pas un mieux que l&amp;rsquo;autre, tout dépends de l&amp;rsquo;utilisation que l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites faire de son téléphone</description>

 Une section Packages vient de voir le jour dans la partie Linux (il était temps !) Une petite documentation sur comment utiliser un DVD Redhat comme repository Une autre sur comment compiler et créer un RPM depuis des sources (exemple avec le projet Openonload) Une petite modification sur l&amp;rsquo;utilisation sur ZFS ARC Cache avec ZFS on Linux Et enfin un petit script pour updater automatiquement les hosts sur Visage (Collectd)  </description>

      <description>Parce qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a marre de cette recherche minable dans MediaWiki, que j&amp;rsquo;ai bougé mes petites fesses et créer une extension pour ajouter à la &amp;ldquo;sidebar&amp;rdquo; : une recherche Google.
Il vous faudra bien entendu être inscrit au Google CSE ou encore Adsense pour pouvoir profiter de la recherche personnalisée. L&amp;rsquo;extension est bien entendue accessible sur Mediawiki ou mon git :
 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GoogleSearch

  L&amp;rsquo;installation est vraiment simple, donc n&amp;rsquo;hésitez pas !</description>

      <description>Et bah voilà, ça fait un moment que ça me trottait dans la tête de mettre en place un Puppet Dashboard, même si pour certaines personnes ça ne sert pas à grand chose. Ca permet au moins d&amp;rsquo;avoir une idée de comment se passe les synchronisations pour les fonctionnalités les plus basiques.
Une autre interface que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé existe, appelée The Forman.
Je testerais peut être plus tard cette interface, mais pour l&amp;rsquo;heure, voici la documentation pour Puppet Dashboard.</description>

      <description>Après m’être acharné sur du GlusterFS, du DRBD+OCFS2 etc… je suis revenu à des choses plus conventionnelles et plus simple à gérer. J’ai donc testé Unison qui m’avait pas trop fait kiffé il y a quelques années du fait que si on veut une synchronisation parfaite, ce n’est pas possible.
Bref, aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui je pense que c&amp;rsquo;est un bon compromis pour ce que je souhaites faire donc voici une petite documentation comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude pour l&amp;rsquo;utilisation standard.</description>

      <description>En février dernier, un groupe de députés européens baptisé LEWP (Law Enforcement Working Party) a commencé à travailler en secret sur un projet de loi dont l’objectif est de mettre en place un grand firewall européen. Soutenus par les lobbies américains, ce projet de loi aura pour but d’exclure d’Europe certains sites internet considérés comme illégaux. Tous les FAI devront alors se plier à cette loi et appliquer ce filtrage Européen.</description>

      <description>Collectd c’est le bien. Mais les interfaces web manquent cruellement de maturité comparé à Munin. Un petit pointe le bout de son nez de plus en plus et se démarque des autres (à mon goût), c’est Visage.
Il manque encore quelques fonctionnalités, mais celles pour comparer ou visualiser un host fonctionnent à merveille. Comme à mon habitude, voici une documentation.</description>

Pour toi public, voici donc la solution. Il faut tout simplement utiliser le module proxy d&amp;rsquo;Apache pour faire une réécriture d&amp;rsquo;URL. La documentation est ici.</description>

      <description>Je viens de commiter la version 0.2 de DeleteHistory qui est compatible avec MediaWiki 1.16.
Ça fait des mois que je suis en test chez moi, ça fonctionne plutôt bien. La semaine dernière j&amp;rsquo;ai reçu un mail d&amp;rsquo;un certain David qui me demandait une version qui fonctionnait sur MediaWiki 1.16.
Il l&amp;rsquo;a donc mis à jour avec succès et ça fonctionne très bien :-)

      <description>Le TRIM permet de modifier le comportement de l’OS avec un disque SSD. Sur Mac OS X, aujourd’hui il n’y a que les SSD “Apple” qui ont cette techno. Le but de cette instruction est de maintenir la vitesse du SSD tout au long de sa vie, évitant le ralentissement que les premiers modèles rencontraient une fois que toutes les cellules étaient écrites au moins une fois.
Heureusement, d&amp;rsquo;autres gens s&amp;rsquo;y sont pencher pour l&amp;rsquo;activer sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel type de SSD.</description>

Vous connaissez déjà peut être Rancid qui permet de faire des backups de vos chers équipements Cisco et de les stocker dans un VCS. Au taf, mon équipe réseaux se plaignait de ne pas pouvoir faire de recherche dans tous les équipements cisco d&amp;rsquo;un coup. Imaginez plusieurs équipements avec pour certain plus de 25000 lignes d&amp;rsquo;ACL et autre configuration VPN.</description>

Il vous permet d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement des logiciels, faire leur configuration et changer l&amp;rsquo;état d&amp;rsquo;un service.
Je viens d&amp;rsquo;énumérer même pas 5% de ce que Puppet est capable de faire. Bref, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà une doc sur mon wiki que je viens d&amp;rsquo;actualiser avec un peu plus d&amp;rsquo;explications et une version squeeze.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour mon wiki avec ma configuration Nagios. Vous allez me dire : &amp;ldquo;Atta&amp;hellip; pouquoi t&amp;rsquo;fais ça, yen a plein sule net, c&amp;rsquo;est po la peine hein !&amp;rdquo;. C&amp;rsquo;est vrai qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a plein sur le net, c&amp;rsquo;est pour ça que la mienne n&amp;rsquo;est pas bourrée d&amp;rsquo;explications et surtout un peu plus particulière que la majorité qu&amp;rsquo;on trouve sur internet.
Etant utilisateur, administrateur et développeur de plugins, ma forte expérience sur Nagios m&amp;rsquo;a permit d&amp;rsquo;apprendre à moduler, simplifier et rendre flexible ma configuration Nagios.</description>

      <title>Mise à jour de sécurité automatique</title>

      <description>Ca fait un moment que ça me trotte dans la tête et voilà, je me suis décidé à mettre ceci en place.
Mon but est d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement les mises à jour de sécurité. Évidement il n&amp;rsquo;est pas vraiment recommandé de faire ce genre de chose, mais sur une Debian, qui est en version stable et ou seul les mise à jour de sécurité sont installées&amp;hellip; on limite les risques.
Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d&amp;rsquo;un outil permettant de faire de genre de choses et je suis tombé sur cron-apt.</description>

      <description>Vendredi j&amp;rsquo;ai passé la certification 202 chez Linagora. J&amp;rsquo;ai reçu une réponse dans la nuit et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc eu ma certification. Je devais la passer car je risquais de perdre les autres que j&amp;rsquo;avais valider en 2006.

      <description>J’avais commencé à faire mon nouveau serveur avant de déménager, mais n’avais pas trop eu le temps d’en parler.
Pour être plus gentil avec la planète et avec mon compte en banque, j&amp;rsquo;ai décidé (idée de ma femme) de migrer mon serveur sur un Mac Mini.
Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas tant besoin de puissance que ça et qu&amp;rsquo;avec les Core 2 Duo qu&amp;rsquo;il y a dans l&amp;rsquo;avant dernière génération (celle que j&amp;rsquo;ai), en y ajoutant un peu de RAM (4Go au total) et un disque qui tient la route (500Go 7200trs/min), ça devrait tenir à l&amp;rsquo;aise le coup.</description>

      <description>Ca fait un moment que je me dit qu’il va falloir étudier le cas de la réplication de fichiers temps réel entre mon serveur perso et ma dedibox. J’en avais un peu marre de mon rsync crontabé (oui le verbe existe).
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris une petite documentation sur GlusterFS sur comment répliquer le /var/www. Dans la pratique c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien :
 Rapide à mettre en place

      <description>Un ami m&amp;rsquo;a demandé un routeur de bonne qualité pour chez lui et assez simple d&amp;rsquo;utilisation. Au début j&amp;rsquo;ai pensé à des produits commerciaux que l&amp;rsquo;on peut trouver dans n&amp;rsquo;importe quelle grande surface un peu spécialisée. Je connais bien les problématiques, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas toujours stable, c&amp;rsquo;est pauvre en options&amp;hellip;
Je possède une Soekris et j&amp;rsquo;en suis très content. Mais le fait d&amp;rsquo;avoir choisis OpenBSD est un choix personnel qui ne correspond pas vraiment à celui de mon ami car pas très user friendly.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai une très mauvaise expérience actuellement avec FreeBSD. J&amp;rsquo;ai effectuer plusieurs tests hard avant de remettre sur FreeBSD.
Pourquoi avais je pris FreeBSD au lieu de Debian ? :
 Pour le ZFS
 Sa réputation
 Pour essayer
  Seulement voilà, quand on commence à faire du fuse + encfs + sshfs&amp;hellip;bah c&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi stable qu&amp;rsquo;on est en droit de penser. J&amp;rsquo;ai des kernel panic qui ne font même pas rebooter ma machine (alors que c&amp;rsquo;est pourtant le comportement par défaut de FreeBSD) visiblement à cause de Fuse ou SSHfs et c&amp;rsquo;est très handicapant.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment mis à jour une baie de disques Sun StorageTek 6140 de la version 6 à la version 7. La tâche n&amp;rsquo;était pas simple, il a fallu tout d&amp;rsquo;abord télécharger des outils spécifique pour effectuer cette upgrade :
http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/820-7197-12&amp;frasl;820-7197-12.pdf
Ensuite, un collègue m&amp;rsquo;a filé ce lien qui permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir les best practice pour faire du RAID 6 :
http://www.filibeto.org/sun/lib/blueprints/820-5825.pdf
Tout ça pour faire du vmware. Il a donc fallu changer le mode de visualisation de la baie par les hosts en vmware et idem encore utiliser les recommandations de Vmware par rapport aux LUN etc&amp;hellip; :</description>

      <description>Il semblerait que du côté de Debian 6 une nomenclature se fasse pour les interfaces réseaux évoluées. J&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré un problème avec mes interfaces bridgées qui n&amp;rsquo;utilisaient pas des noms &amp;ldquo;génériques&amp;rdquo;. En fait les scripts de base proposés par Debian comportent en dur des noms qu&amp;rsquo;il est préférable d&amp;rsquo;utiliser.
Pour ceux que ça intéressent voici mes déboires sur OpenVZ.</description>

Mon coeur à a ce moment palpité, mais mon cerveau à eu quelques soupçons. Après tests, il s&amp;rsquo;avère que c&amp;rsquo;est tout simplement génial ! A peine 5 min que je suis dessus et je kiffe. Je cherchais tellement ce type de soft pour Thunderbird !</description>

      <description>N’ayant pas une connexion internet de dingue et utilisant des machines virtuelles, il devient vite pénible de devoir attendre 50 ans pour télécharger les même paquets pour toutes ces VMs. Donc j’ai cherché une solution pour avoir un espèce de cache spécialement pour apt.
J&amp;rsquo;ai trouvé mon bonheur avec apt-cacher-ng qui d&amp;rsquo;après ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai lu est la solution la plus aboutie aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui.
Pour la petite doc, ça se passe ici.</description>

Et ça tombe super bien ça ! Parce que je viens de réinstaller mon serveur (sur mon mac mini) et j&amp;rsquo;ai justement utiliser Debian 6 (je ferais un post bientôt là dessus).</description>

Seulement voilà, le problème c’est que malgré qu’il y ai une 10 d’interfaces, elles sont toutes assez moche et peu fonctionnelle. Bref, il faut en utiliser plusieurs pour avoir un truc sympas.
Voici celles qui m&amp;rsquo;ont semblées intéressantes :
 Collection3  Interface simpliste, mais utile. C&amp;rsquo;est celle de base qui est plus ou moins recommandé par Collectd.</description>

En faisant le reboot 2 disques de sont raid 5 sont endommagés (1 qui fait clic clic et l’autre visiblement le problème de firmware Seagate….il avait pourtant flashé à l’époque pour ne pas que ça arrive).
Il essaye donc d&amp;rsquo;en faire repartir 1 et par miracle il y arrive.</description>

Même si ça a quelques contraintes de confidentialités, on peut générer de vrais certificats SSL reconnu nativement (dans la liste des autorités de certification) sur tout bon browser web qui se respecte.
Il y a plusieurs niveau, gratuits et payant. Le niveau gratuit permet de faire déjà pas mal de trucs, je vous laisse consulter ma doc si vous voulez faire de même et le site (StarCom) si vous voulez en savoir plus.</description>

Je me suis donc intéressé à la chose et suis très satisfait du résultat. C&amp;rsquo;est très rapide, il existe plusieurs interfaces graphiques (plus ou moins jolie, plus ou moins fonctionnelles) et surtout, il y a une tonne de modules de base pour Collectd !</description>

On va donc éviter de tout refaire hein :-) ! Et c’est là que Ditaa entre en jeu ! Il est écrit en java et permet simplement une conversion. Voici l’exemple d’un schéma ASCII :

      <description>J’ai eu une petite mésaventure depuis quelques mois au taf avec ce merveilleux filesystem qu’est ZFS. Le problème est simple, j’ai des machines à 72Go de RAM et ne peut dépasser ~ les 48Go.
Comment ça se fait ? Tout simplement parce que ZFS se réserve 1&amp;frasl;8 de la mémoire dispo (RAM+SWAP) pour son cache. Sur des petites config ça ne se voit pas mais sur des machines avec autant de RAM, ça ait mal.</description>

      <description>Sans parler des terminaux qui sont à des années lumières des téléphones portables classiques, le serveur c’est vraiment une merde. Ca s’améliore d’année en année, mais quand même… quelle merde !
C&amp;rsquo;est buggé a mort. Tous les outils de diagnostiques disent que tout fonctionne, et pourtant, aucuns mails relayé. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite doc avec tous les prérequis, les check à faire&amp;hellip;
Pour ma part, tous les checks disaient que tout fonctionnaient bien mais il m&amp;rsquo;a fallu appliquer un Service Pack pour que tout refonctionne.</description>

      <description>Encore une fois, ça a été la tannée avec ce Packet Filter ! Ils changent tout le temps pas mal de trucs. Mon serveur était donc inaccessible cette nuit à cause de cette upgrade.
J&amp;rsquo;ai déjà encore galérer pour foutre ce putain de PXE. J&amp;rsquo;ai pourtant suivit ma doc que j&amp;rsquo;avais faite précédemment, mais là, rien à faire, le PXE ne voulait pas être reconnu. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc décider d&amp;rsquo;en faire un sous OpenBSD (OpenBSD pour installer OpenBSD, quoi de plus naturelle&amp;hellip;) et vais améliorer la doc ici.</description>

Pour résumer, j&amp;rsquo;ai pour le moment fait un dual boot avec Ubuntu. Je suis toujours à la recherche d&amp;rsquo;une solution correcte pour lire et écrire sur de l&amp;rsquo;ext4 depuis Mac OS. Ubuntu marche d&amp;rsquo;enfer sur ce mac, et pour finir, je me suis fais chier à faire un clavier Français PC pour Mac OS.</description>

      <description>SSLH est comme un tour de magie. Il permet par exemple sur une adresse WAN sur le port 443 d’avoir du HTTPS et du SSH. Comment c’est possible ??? On peut mettre un même port d’écoute sur un même port !
Effectivement ! Il faut simplement voir SSLH comme un proxy de couche 7 capable de filtrer et différencier les trames SSL des trames SSH.
Et voici une petite documentation et un correctif pour OpenBSD.</description>

Voilà donc un plugin qui permet de parser un fichier, et de garder ou non les lignes qui nous intéressent. En plus de celà on peut spécifier, s&amp;rsquo;il faut un certain nombre de lignes pour que le plugin retourne une valeur positive.</description>

      <description>Deimos vient encore de frapper ! Cette semaine, en parlant avec des amis du taf, je me suis rappeler de l’époque ou j’avais BluePhoneElite sur Mac. C’est un soft qui me permettait d’être (entre autre car il a beaucoup plus de fonctionnalités que ça) connecté avec mon téléphone portable en bluetooth à mon mac et lorsque je m’éloignais, l’ordi se vérouillait.
Je regrette que cette fonctionnalité là n&amp;rsquo;existe pas sur Linux.</description>

      <description>Et bien me voilà encore en pleine créativité, on ne m’arrête plus !!!! Pour la petite histoire, il y a maintenant peut être 2 ans, je cherchais une extension pour MediaWiki me permettant de supprimer mon historique. J’avais trouvé l’extension parfaite SpecialDeleteOldRevisions, mais lors d’une upgrade, impossible de la faire fonctionner correctement. Toujours pas d’update de cette extension 1 an après. Je m’étais dis que j’en ferais une un de ces 4.</description>

Puis je me suis souvenu que le HTML 5 arrivait à grand pas et qu&amp;rsquo;il y avait un support video. Je me suis donc penché un peu plus sur la question et voilà ce que je trouver : 2 formats existent pour le moment OGV (Libre et gratuit) et H264 (Payant à l&amp;rsquo;utilisation, mais vu que je suis un particulier etc&amp;hellip; personne ira vérifier, surtout pour des videos perso).</description>

En l’absence de documentation sur l’extension SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi j’ai du me farcir le code à la mainet trouver comment setter des valeurs par défaut. J’ai donc maintenant “line=1 start=0” à tous mes codes sur mon wiki sans me prendre la tête à l’écrire à chaque fois.</description>

J’ai été très étonné par la simplicité de la configuration par rapport à Apache qui au fil du temps est devenu une grosse usine à gaz. Avec Lighttpd, ils deviennent des alternatives vraiment sérieuses à Apache avec surtout les performances et optimisation des ressources nettement meilleures.</description>

Mon petit script récupère les noms des bases de données, liste les tables et optimise tout ce petit monde pour gagner de l’espace sur le disque :-). Bref, je ne vais pas expliquer de long en large ce que fait la fonction ‘OPTIMIZE’ de MySQL mais en gros l’idée est là.

      <description>Dans un précédent post, j’expliquais comment faire des exe sous Windows. Je vais donc expliquer pourquoi :
Dans ma boite, j&amp;rsquo;ai des personnes mal intentionnées qui avaient les droits admin de leur machine. Le problème c&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;avec ça ils peuvent en faire des conneries&amp;hellip;
Pour palier à ce problème, on les a mis en utilisateurs. Et pour ne pas que si quelqu&amp;rsquo;un trouve le mot de passe admin, qu&amp;rsquo;il puisse se connecter sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel ordinateur pour prendre des informations, il faut un mot de passe unique par ordinateur.</description>

Le portage de Perl sur Windows est vraiment très bien fait et ça fonctionne quasiment pareil que sur les *nix. Biensure, il y a quelques petites différences comme les chemins des dossiers etc…, mais franchement, du fait qu’on puisse utiliser les API Windows, c’est vraiment balaise.</description>

Actuellement sur mon serveur, je tourne avec KVM et libvirt. J&amp;rsquo;en suis plutôt très satisfait. Seulement voilà, entre MySecureShell avec lequel on doit compiler sur beaucoup de plateformes et mes autres VM dont j&amp;rsquo;ai besoin au quotidien, les 4Go de RAM de la machine ne suffisent pas forcément et je suis au maximum des capacités RAM sur celle ci.</description>

Donc voilà Chrome est sensé faire tout ce que fait Firefox, mais en mieux. Un peu septique, j&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même voulu tenter l&amp;rsquo;aventure.
Mon bilan est dressé au bout d&amp;rsquo;une heure d&amp;rsquo;utilisation.</description>

      <description>Décidément, je n’arrête pas ces temps ci ! Là c’est un petit projet par rapport aux autres, mais c’est peut être pour le moment un de ceux que je vais utiliser le plus souvent car très utile pour mon boulot.
Un peu d&amp;rsquo;explication ne fait pas de mal. J&amp;rsquo;utilise depuis des années MediaWiki et en suis pleinement satisfait ! Au boulot, il y a quelques années aussi, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas réussi à faire appliquer MediaWiki car il ne prenait pas en charge le WIZIWIG et une gestion des ACLs simple.</description>

      <description>Depuis le début de la semaine et jusqu’à aujourd’hui, j’ai un expert MySQL qui est à côté de moi au taf. C’est fou tout ce qu’on peut apprendre :-p. Pour moi les optimisations MySQL n’étaient nécessaire que quand des milliers de personnes font des requêtes ou quand vraiment on ressent de grosses pertes de perfs etc…
Nous avons eu besoin de lui car c&amp;rsquo;est les pertes de perfs qui nous troublaient.</description>

      <description>Depuis quelques temps je me suis mis à faire toute sorte de graphs. Vous l’avez vu dans un de mes précédents posts avec OpenChart et maintenant RRDtool. Je ne vous cacherais pas que c’est un peu complexe a prendre en main, mais une fois fait, on peut vraiment tout faire et on comprends aisément pourquoi il est utilisé partout.
Le mécanisme de base de donnée est extrêment bien pensé et surtout autonome, ce qui le rends très pratique et facile anticiper les éventuels problèmes de place liés à de multiples bases de données RRD (puisque maitrisée).</description>

Je prévois de belles améliorations mais pour le moment, ça vous permet de faire simplement un beau CV sans trop se fouler.
Il me reste un beau README a faire, mais pour l&amp;rsquo;heure voici en gros les quelques fonctionnalités :
 Bi languages
 Partie confidentielle gérée
 Calcul automatique de l&amp;rsquo;age

      <description>J’ai découvert dans le dernier Linux Mag HS un shell permettant de limiter les accès aux commandes pour les utilisateurs. Il possède aussi quelques options pour le sftp, mais est très loin d’égaler MySecureShell.
En disposant donc MySecureShell en shell primaire, puis en déclarant lshell en shell sous-jacent (dans la conf de MySecureShell), on peut alors parfaitement maitriser les faits et gestes de nos précieux utilisateurs afin qu&amp;rsquo;ils ne fassent pas de bêtises.</description>

Je copie donc mon contenu à l&amp;rsquo;arrache en me disant que la PS3 va automatiquement détecter en fonction des extensions des fichiers si c&amp;rsquo;est des photos, musiques ou films&amp;hellip;et bah non ! Quedal ! Ca marche pas vraiment comme ça. Réencoder les films ?</description>

Bref heureusement j&amp;rsquo;ai un raid 5 sur 4 disques et je n&amp;rsquo;ai qu&amp;rsquo;1 disque qui est tombé en panne. C&amp;rsquo;est donc arrivé samedi et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc racheté un disque Seagate (pas que j&amp;rsquo;aime me faire du mal, mais la série de disques défectueux est passée et en plus je trouve que les Seagate sont très très bon pour tourner 24/24h.</description>

 check_sun_cluster : qui permet de surveiller l&amp;rsquo;état du cluster sun check_multi_procs : permet de surveiller plusieurs process dans un seul check  Et puis j&amp;rsquo;ai pu en améliorer d&amp;rsquo;autres :
 check_backuppc_hosts : ajout d&amp;rsquo;une fonctionnalité pour monitorer qu&amp;rsquo;un seuil hôte  Voilà donc mes dernières œuvres.</description>

      <description>Je pense avoir trouvé le plugin Eclipse qu’il me fallait. Il utilise en fait gvim. Mon problème était donc d’adapter gvim pour qu’il puisse utiliser ma conf de vim. Tout ne passait pas correctement, j’ai donc adapter comme il fallait mon .vimrc afin qu’il se rapproche au mieux de vim.
Il faut donc installer le plugin à l&amp;rsquo;adresse suivante : http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/.
Un une fois installé, il faut l&amp;rsquo;activer dans les préférences gvim, puis l&amp;rsquo;associer aux extensions de fichier souhaité.</description>

      <description>Sur les conseils de mon ami Seb (Teka), je me suis mis à utiliser un IDE pour développer dans toute sorte de language afin de gagner en souplesse et en rapidité.
Du coup, j&amp;rsquo;utilise Eclipse. Cependant, de base, il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas grand chose qui m&amp;rsquo;intéresse puisque c&amp;rsquo;est assez spécifique à Java et je ne développe pas en Java. Il existe donc tout un tas d&amp;rsquo;addons et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis sur mon wiki ceux que j&amp;rsquo;utilise.</description>

Ca donne quand même une belle doc du fait que la complexité de la chose. En effet, pas de grande similitudes avec les ACL Linux pour le côté utilisation, parcontre dans les faits, le système est assez similaire.</description>

 Solaris
 MySQL
 SPARC
  MySQL, j&amp;rsquo;y croyais pas du tout, mais c&amp;rsquo;est super, je suis content. J&amp;rsquo;espère qu&amp;rsquo;xVM Server va également sortir rapidement en stable etc&amp;hellip; Je trouve parcontre vraiment dommage qu&amp;rsquo;ils abandonnent OpenSolaris. C&amp;rsquo;était, je pense, une très bonne solution pour améliorer la stabilité de leurs produits finaux et intéresser un plus large publique bien que Solaris soit aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui gratuit.</description>

      <description>Et bah voilà ! Un rm sur le / et sur une machine de prod. Heureusement, pas en vraiment en prod, mais pré prod ouf. J’étais sur que ça allait m’arriver un jour ! Ca fait 2 fois ! La dernière fois c’était ya ptete 5 ans chez moi. Tout ça parceque le shell il dit pas ou t’es, que ya pas de rm -i. Enfin bref, va falloir faire un shell de prod c’est sur !</description>

      <description>Toi ! Oui toi fidèle lecteur ! Tu ne connais pas dropbox ? C’est simple, c’est une application qui tourne sous Linux/Mac/Windaube et qui te permet de mettre des fichiers (peut importe quoi) dessus et tu as 2Go disponible sur un serveur. Tu peux y accéder de n’importe ou en web, ce qui est très pratique.
Et quand tu a gouter à ce soft, tu peux difficilement t&amp;rsquo;en séparer. Et là, ils viennent de sortir l&amp;rsquo;application sur iPhone !</description>

      <description>François un de mes collègues, m’a apprit aujourd’hui que Heartbeat n’était plus maintenu depuis l’année dernière et qu’ils avaient décidés de merger avec Pacemaker pour avoir un produit encore plus abouti.
Pacemaker est en fait un espèce de Heartbeat 3 (trouvé sur la doc officelle) avec comme framework OpenAIS qui est en fait une librairie pouvant être appellée via API. Un peu à la manière de KVM/Xen et libvirt.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc une mode et ça nous replonge encore dans du temps passer à lire et lire des docs.</description>

      <description>Solaris est super évolué sur certaines technos, mais alors sur certains trucs comme les packages, c’est une horreur ! Exemple :
 Très mauvaise gestion des dépendances
 Pas de repository (je parle en natif, sinon il existe pkgget)
 Pas d&amp;rsquo;utilisation simple
  Bref, un bon coup de pied au cul leur ferait pas de mal à Sun. Espérons que le rachat par Oracle améliorera les points archaïque qui mette à ce bel OS des coups de freins à tous ceux qui voudraient l&amp;rsquo;utiliser.</description>

      <description>Vous devriez voir une nette différence avec mon blog sous memcached. Le wiki y est depuis déjà quelques années, mais le blog non car il n’y avait pas vraiment de possibilités durant l’installation ou avec les extensions actuelle.
J&amp;rsquo;ai réussi à mettre la main sur cet arcticle qui me permet de pondre une documentation assez complète sur la mise en place de memcached sur WordPress.
Alors, trouvez vous le blog plus rapide ?</description>

 Par open relay
 Par open proxy
 Par modification de clef SSH
  Il nous revient avec un nouveau challenge ! Steeves is back ! Mais pas complètement de sa faute cette fois. Disons qu&amp;rsquo;un de ses potes n&amp;rsquo;a apparemment pas de notions de développement sécurisé.</description>

Pour résumer c&amp;rsquo;est un mec qui se plaint d&amp;rsquo;un soit disant bug sur Debian et qui envoie via reportbug son soucis avec un minimum d&amp;rsquo;infos. La personne du support lui en demande plus et quelques messages plus tard, l&amp;rsquo;utilisateur dit :
 THAT&amp;rsquo;S ALL THE INFO I GOT FROM THE FUCKING SOFTWARE!

J&amp;rsquo;ai le truc qu&amp;rsquo;il vous faut, c&amp;rsquo;est en flash, ça génère des graphs trop classe, bref le kiffe. Ca s&amp;rsquo;appelle Open Flash Chart. Le nom est pas très originale certe, mais au moins ça a le mérite d&amp;rsquo;être beau et efficace.

Bref, Google Reader permet de centraliser ses flux RSS. Ouai et alors ça sert à quoi puisqu&amp;rsquo;on peut les foutre dans Firefox ou dans un soft pour RSS ?</description>

Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas ça fait de la colorisation syntaxique sur pas mal de différents codes.

Documentation on Sun Cluster
Je vous suggère, si vous savez comment fonctionne un cluster de lire ma doc si c&amp;rsquo;est la première fois que vous faites une install, car il faut se tirer les cheveux quelques fois avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver à faire une installe propre par rapport aux exigences de Sun.</description>

Mon précédent post parlait de l&amp;rsquo;environnement et du film Home qui m&amp;rsquo;a déclenché l&amp;rsquo;envie d&amp;rsquo;accélérer un projet que j&amp;rsquo;ai commencé il y a quelques mois maintenant appellé phpWOL (php Wake On Lan).
Je vais le continuer en partenaria avec Teka (Sébastien), mon ami avec qui je fais MySecureShell également afin d&amp;rsquo;accélérer son développement.
phpWOL a pour but de démarrer des machines à distance.</description>

Une fois le son des Sims coupés (:-p) j&amp;rsquo;étais ennuyé parce que le bruit ne me disait vraiment pas grand chose.</description>

Ce matin en lisant mes news google reader habituelles, c&amp;rsquo;est howtoforge qui nous pond un article sur l&amp;rsquo;ATA Over Ethernet. Je trouvais que le nom sonnait bien.
Je commence à faire quelques petites recherches, déjà la mise en place parait relativement aisée, plutôt bon point, cependant, le débit n&amp;rsquo;a pas l&amp;rsquo;air délirant et apparemment il existe quelques petits problèmes de rapidité (certainement dû à la jeunesse) pour le moment.</description>

Je suis certain que c&amp;rsquo;est dû aux images qcow2 (ceux qui me disent &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo;est à cause de tes disques&amp;rsquo; peuvent remballer leur langue car pour rappel, je suis en raid5 sur 4 disques).
Malheureusement, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas de preuves pour affirmer ce que je dis plus haut, mais c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt l&amp;rsquo;experience que j&amp;rsquo;ai avec les images disques qui me faire dire ça.</description>

Depuis quelques temps, mon ami Momo (pour ceux qui le connaissent) me parle de Centreon par ci, Centreon par là, &amp;ldquo;quand est-ce que tu me le met en place etc&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.
Chaque chose en son temps ! D&amp;rsquo;abord ca a été Nagios pour lui, et maintenant on aperçoit le bout du nez de Centreon. Pour rappel, il permet de faire une conf tout en graphique de Nagios et permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir des graphs sur l&amp;rsquo;historique (pour résumer vulgairement).</description>

      <title>FreeNas : J’y croyais pas</title>

      <description>FreeNas est une distribution FreeBSD remodelée pour faire un l’équivalent d’un NAS. Et le résultat est assez bluffant :
 Mis en place en * de 2 min
 Mise à dispo d&amp;rsquo;une interface web belle et simple
 Pleins de protocoles intégrés
 Légère
  Ca me donne envie de me faire un PC et de dédier à ça (émuler une baie de stockage quoi).
Il y a une autre solution vieillissante aparement aussi (j&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé) qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle OpenFiler qui a l&amp;rsquo;air d&amp;rsquo;être dans le même goût mais avec une documentation payante (un peu la blague).</description>

      <description>Depuis la version 8.10 d’Ubuntu, ma souris Logitech Revolution ne fonctionne plus comme avant. J’essaye donc de retrouver le petit petit à petit ce qui me manque. En gros :
 La sélection de texte qui copie automatiquement dans le presse papier (clipboard)
 Le bouton gauche de la souris qui effectue un coller du clipboard
  Et bien ces 2 trucs là, je galère depuis longtemps à les retrouver et je pensais enfin avoir réussi.</description>

      <description>Suite à mon précédent post sur le versionning, j’ai donc décidé en mon âme et conscience, de choisir Git.
Je dois avoué que je suis assez surpris par les nouvelles fonctionnalités qui changent un peu de SVN, mais c&amp;rsquo;est quand même vraiment pas mal !
J&amp;rsquo;entends la foule crier au loin &amp;ldquo;la doc, la doc&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, oui oui elle est là et prête : Doc sur Git
Ouali oulaou, que ceux qu&amp;rsquo;on des questions n&amp;rsquo;aysyttepeua !</description>

      <description>Je suis tiraillé entre plusieurs trucs. J’aimerais mettre un soft de versionning pour tout ce que je développe. Seulement voilà, je ne sais pas bien quoi mettre au juste :
 CVS : vieux, plus vraiment mis à jour, mais standart
 SVN : plus récent, plus performant que CVS mais qui commence déjà à vieillir, mais standart aussi
 Git : encore plus récent, plus performant, moins gourmand en disque qu&amp;rsquo;SVN ?</description>

      <description>Bon… allez, je vais vous expliquer déjà pourquoi j’ai refais mon serveur.
Dans mes précédents posts datant du mois de décembre, vous avez pu lire que j&amp;rsquo;étais passé de mon serveur Debian 32 bits etch (stable de l&amp;rsquo;époque) vers Solaris et adoptant la virtualisation avec VirtualBox le temps de patienter pour xVM Server.
Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, xVM Server n&amp;rsquo;est toujours pas sorti, VirtualBox n&amp;rsquo;est vraiment, vraiment pas fait pour de la pseudo prod (donc imaginez la prod), contrairement à ce qui est dit sur le site officiel de Sun.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, je contribue. C’est rare car je n’ai pas toujours le temps de faire quelque chose de générique, mais là c’est le cas, donc j’en fais profiter tout le monde.
J&amp;rsquo;ai développer un plugins Nagios pour checker l&amp;rsquo;état de bon fonctionnement de BackupPC. J&amp;rsquo;ai fais avec les moyens du bord et je suis sûr qu&amp;rsquo;il y a moyen de faire plus simple.
En attendant, voici le lien : http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Backup-and-Recovery/BackupPC/check_backuppc_hosts/details</description>

      <description>Bon là ça y est, j’en peux plus !
Je viens de vendre mon mac par exemple et voici ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai comme problèmes :
 Les transferts en SSH déconnent (s&amp;rsquo;arrête au bout d&amp;rsquo;un certain temps) avec Cyberduck.
 Sur le serveur, j&amp;rsquo;ai une clef USB branchée dessus, c&amp;rsquo;est ultra lent pour copier un truc.
 Aucunes souplesses avec Solaris.
  Donc voilà, ça y est, ça fait un moment que j&amp;rsquo;en parle, il me faut du temps pour refaire mon serveur là.</description>

 Les pertes de perfs réseaux
 Les problèmes de paravirtualisation VT sous VirtualBox
 Les perfs en générale
  J&amp;rsquo;en peux plus. C&amp;rsquo;est super décourageant. Alors maintenant on va se poser les vrais questions :

 Migration Debian etch 32 bits vers Solaris x86_64
 Mise en place de VMs :
 OpenBSD 4.4
 Debian (ou ubuntu server, je ne sais pas trop encore)
