      <description>Some of you may not be familiar withÂ the terms &amp;ldquo;Rolling upgrade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Rolling restart&amp;rdquo;. This is the action ofÂ upgrading or restarting a cluster without service interruption (alias zero downtime). In most cases, this is done node by node, but in fact it depends of the technology you&amp;rsquo;re managing and the number of active nodes in your cluster.
AtÂ NousmotardsÂ we have several Java Spring Boot applications running. Restarting one applicationÂ can take up to 1 min.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
In my previous post, I talked about how to speed up reads and writes couplingÂ RedisÂ withÂ Neo4J. Now I want to share with you how it&amp;rsquo;s possible to unload your server and use Elasticsearch to speed up news feed and user wall.
1/ Show me your news feed A news feed is the main page of traditional social networks. ItsÂ main goal is to showÂ you all recents updates from your friends and your interests.</description>

      <description>Neo4J is the most popular graph database in the NoSQL databasesÂ family. We&amp;rsquo;re using it in the Nousmotards projectÂ to store all socialÂ data through nodes and relationships.
Today I am going to talk about our experience after having using it for 2 years now (take a look atÂ directedÂ graphÂ if you are not really familiar with Graph Database).
1/ Our use case Nousmotards is a social network for bikers, we aim to provide valuable tools to ride, meet and share niceÂ time with people who like motorcycling.</description>

      <title>Docker: why you should use Monit instead of supervisord</title>

      <description>This title can sounds like a troll, but this is not the case! I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as a feedback. When I spoke during an Ansible meetup presenting Nousmotards infrastructure, I had several questions regarding why I chose monit as the init system instead of supervisord. That&amp;rsquo;s what encouraged me to write this post and that&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to clarify here the things.
Introduction Docker is made to run a process in a confined area.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Graphite at work and for my Nousmotards project. For Nousmotards, I&amp;rsquo;m using the Graphite version available in the default Debian Jessie repositories. This to avoid mismatch django dependencies etc&amp;hellip;
A few days ago, I wanted to try Graphite events to get something pretty cool in Grafana :
This to be able to know when a new app version is deployed and make it easier to understand when an issue occurs.</description>

      <description>Hi all ! Long time since last blog post ! I&amp;rsquo;m using Jenkins with Ansible on my Nousmotards project for building docker containers or deploying into production.
You may noticed that you&amp;rsquo;ve no Ansible color when running it into Jenkins! The simple way to correct it is to export an environment variable in your Jenkins job:
export ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true Now that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool! However, you may also noticed that there&amp;rsquo;s some kind of lags on the console when you want to see a real time console log on Jenkins.</description>

      <description>A long long time since my last blog post ! I didn&amp;rsquo;t had the time to make one because of the time I spent on building Nousmotards infrastructure.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how I built the infrastructure, come and see us on the Ansible Meetup next Tuesday ðŸ˜‰ The slides and video of the Meetup will be made and available on InfoQ.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a French biker, do not hesitate anymore!</description>
