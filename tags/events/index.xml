      <description>I forgot to talk about 1 meetup I&amp;rsquo;ve been regarding Neo4j. A friend (evomusic) talked to me about it and as I&amp;rsquo;m curious, I went to this meetup in July. Neo4j is a highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph database. Neo4j is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading startups, enterprises, and governments around the world.
I you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is a graph database, it&amp;rsquo;s a very good introduction and will help you to understand what it is and how it works.</description>

Getting started with MySQL Performance Schema
First of all, I started with a MySQL Performance Schema presentation :

I saw that I had underestimated the power of Performance schema ! We can for example see iowaits and waiting time on tables files.</description>
