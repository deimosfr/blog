      <title>Do not waste time with grep anymore, use tag</title>

      <description>Long time since my last post. This one is not very technical post, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nice to have solution if you use grep usually. Are not you fed up to type vim  and search the line after a grep command ? If yes, this post is for you.
First of all, you may know that an alternative more user friendly to grep exist, called ag (perf comparison). I really like ag and grep, but something make me loose my time since several years and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s your case too.</description>

      <description>Some of you may not be familiar with the terms &amp;ldquo;Rolling upgrade&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Rolling restart&amp;rdquo;. This is the action of upgrading or restarting a cluster without service interruption (alias zero downtime). In most cases, this is done node by node, but in fact it depends of the technology you&amp;rsquo;re managing and the number of active nodes in your cluster.
At Nousmotards we have several Java Spring Boot applications running. Restarting one application can take up to 1 min.</description>

      <title>Upgrading Ansible Consul Template role</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2015/11/27/upgrading-ansible-consul-template-role/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2015/11/27/upgrading-ansible-consul-template-role/</guid>
      <description>As I wanted to upgrade it and because it has been asked several time, I upgraded the consul-template Ansible role to manage official binaries (and upgrades). Here are the new vars:
consul_template_version: &amp;#39;0.11.0&amp;#39; consul_template_arch: &amp;#39;linux_amd64&amp;#39; consul_template_http_src: &amp;quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/releases/download/v{{consul_template_version}}/consul_template_{{consul_template_version}}_{{consul_template_arch}}.zip&amp;quot;  You can of course find the role to Ansible Galaxy: https://galaxy.ansible.com/deimosfr/consul-template/
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this new version :-)</description>

      <description>I recently had the chance to get the latest MacBookPro 13 for my new work at Criteo. If you follow me and remember, this is not the first time I want to use Debian on a new MacBookPro version.
Overview History repeats itself and as you can think, some things are not working out of the box on Debian Jessie. Here are the issues I encountered and how i could fix some of them:</description>

      <description>Debian 8 is out ! After several months of freeze, it&amp;rsquo;s now ready. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about that version because MySecureShell is finally available in the mainstream packages and the second thing is MariaDB available in the latest stable version (10).
Unfortunately, Docker is not present because it has too fast cycles to be stable (source). Thanks to Debian teams for this amazing work once again :-)</description>

Really happy to start this new job :-)</description>

L&amp;rsquo;idée est simple, vous êtes motards, vous aimez les balades à moto&amp;hellip;l&amp;rsquo;application est faites pour vous !
Aucune application n&amp;rsquo;est à l&amp;rsquo;heure actuelle disponible sur Smartphone qui fait ce que nous proposons. Il s&amp;rsquo;agit d&amp;rsquo;une application à la Facebook like, ou vous pouvez inviter des amis, créer des clubs de moto, proposer et planifier des itinéraires, partager vos parcours effectués et beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;autres choses.</description>

      <description>For a new project (will talk about it later), I needed to use Neo4J (graph database if you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet).
I tried to cover more features than the current existing Ansible roles available on Ansible Galaxy. More will come in the next weeks. I also tried to make it simple to install it and do not force dependencies at maximum. Here are parameters you can set:
# Select neo4j version neo4j_package: neo4j # community version #neo4j_package: neo4j-advanced #neo4j_package: neo4j-enterprise # Neo4j spatial plugin neo4j_install_spatial: false neo4j_spatial_version: &amp;#39;0.</description>

      <description>Since several weeks, I&amp;rsquo;m playing a lot with Debian Jessie as a server. I discovered some bugs, reported them to Debian, they&amp;rsquo;ve been fixed etc&amp;hellip;good news! I also wanted to test the new version of LXC.
So I decided to upgrade my 2 personal servers to Jessie. But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so easy with Systemd. I still encounter non critical issues and going to prepare report bugs for Debian (cgroups issues with systemd).</description>

      <description>For another personal project (that I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about for the moment ;-)), I wanted to have a Changelog file to get a better following of the infrastructure evolution (configuration management, scripts&amp;hellip;all under git). Of course the documentation is very important, but when you do not write it at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re building the infrastructure, it may be complex to remember each little things you&amp;rsquo;ve done. That&amp;rsquo;s why a Changelog can help to understand how the infrastructure has been built step by step.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I wanted to play with HAProxy SSL offloading. It was a good experience and alternative to Nginx SSL offloading (I already talked about in this blog). But this is not the topic here&amp;hellip;
When I was trying to make the offload working on the blog, I modified WordPress options which switched my blog into an infinite loop mode. As it was late and I was tired (bad idea), I just wanted to rollback my changes and needed to recover a SQL backup to do it fast.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I already talked about offloading SSL with Nginx. I also wanted to try it with HAProxy which can be more interesting in some cases.
The good On HAProxy, the good thing is the simplicity to do it. First of all you need to have at least the version 1.5 of HAProxy so to get SSL support. Then you only need those lines to offload SSL:</description>

      <description>Packer is a really great solution to make an image in several formats (VirtualBox, Docker&amp;hellip;). I recently wanted to deploy it on a Jenkins server to automatically perform image build with the help of Packer.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a Packer role for Ansible really easy to use. You simply have to set (or let them by defaults) vars:
# Packer version to install packer_version: &amp;#39;0.7.5&amp;#39; # Packer destination folder packer_destination: &amp;#39;/usr/bin&amp;#39;  It will install the desired version :-)</description>

      <description>For my company, I recently had to find a good solution to make Snapshots from Instance IDs or from tags on AWS. I made several searches but unfortunately didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I was searching for.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to make a tool to do this kind of job. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python and requires the Boto library. Here is what you can do with Simple EC2 snapshots:
 Hot snapshots (by default) and Cold snapshots   Multiple instances snapshot in one line   Detection of doubles   Filters by tags (allowing wildcards) or by instance IDs   Credentials file multiple with profiles   Limit the number of snapshots   Restrict snapshots to data disks only   The tool is open source and can be downloaded on GitHub :-).</description>

      <description>About 2 months ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve been contacted to join an a team of 5 persons, on making (once again) a solution to find love. So many solutions already exists today, but this one is a little bit different in my opinion, that&amp;rsquo;s why I accepted to take part of the adventure.
This solution is interesting because you&amp;rsquo;re anonymous. This can help you a lot if you&amp;rsquo;re shy. This kind of Phone application would help me a lot in the past if it was existing !</description>

      <description>If like me, you were using the Ansible Galaxy website to find and download your playbook for your favorite apps, you may missed a feature.
It happened to me when I had to manage several playbook roles. I first wanted to use Git submodules to do it. However I preferred to search another way to do like like Puppet can do with R10K because I am working on a project with some unfamiliar Git users.</description>

      <description>Following the deployment blog post I made on ES/Kibana/Fluentd, I released new version of Fluentd and Kibana playbooks to support the latests versions of themselves and ElasticSearch.
ElasticSearch 1.4 version is ,out which doesn&amp;rsquo;t changed anything for the deployment. However Kibana requires to enable an ElasticSearch configuration option now, to work properly. I updated the Kibana playbook for it.
On its side, Fluentd has the major release 2.0 out and I updated Ansible playbook for the best integration with Debian Wheezy.</description>

You may already seen that this week I made less blog posts as I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any quite big subjects to talk about or time to prepare.
Thanks to follow me, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make better posts new but a little bit less.</description>

      <description>First of all I will only talk about open sources solutions. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to take part of any commercial one. In addition, I will focus on only 4 solutions which seem to me the most used at this time. I will also talk about my history, my level on each one and why I recommend or not that solution.
Puppet is in my opinion the most known solution. Because of the marketing they were/are doing, because it was a good alternative compared to the old cfengine.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s starting to be harder and harder to write good articles every 2 days. Some of you tell me that I should make less blog posts with better quality. However others tell me that they don&amp;rsquo;t care about quality because they&amp;rsquo;ve learned something anyway.
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to make this choice by my own and prefer let this to you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy if you could answer to this poll:</description>

      <description>I recently saw a blog post (don&amp;rsquo;t remember the link :-() on something I used several times but never made an article on. So this time, I&amp;rsquo;m making a blog post on it as this is solution is very useful.
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you already had to tcpdump on a remote server to investigate. When you have a lot of traffic, it can start to be painful to add a lot filter, having no colors, reading tcpdump row format etc&amp;hellip; And most of the time Wireshark can help on having a better visibility on what happens.</description>

I remembered that there was a very good RSS reader on iOS called Reeder. Unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support any self hosted solution instead of Fever. I already used it a few months ago. But I switched to TinyTiny RSS for several reasons and want to keep it.</description>

 WordPress 4: no big updates at the first view but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see how this project works and grow (videos, WYSIWYG,&amp;hellip;) HAProxy 1.5: Offlloading SSL embedded, Full HTTP Keepalive, ACL enhancement&amp;hellip; BIG update! MySecureShell 2.0: Using GnuTLS instead of OpenSSL, available in Debian upstream repositories, new doc&amp;hellip; Nginx 1.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I played with Synology Photo Station and AWS Glacier. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t convinced me a lot and I wanted to find a better alternative.
And here is the one I&amp;rsquo;m going to use called Lychee. It&amp;rsquo;s a PHP based solution available on GitHub.
I really like that solution which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of features, but enough to be used for personal usage and for family.</description>

      <title>Automatic package creation, which one to choose?</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/10/30/automatic-package-creation-which-one-to-choose/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing a complete packaging stack based on Docker to easily make different kind of packages for several Linux distributions. This for MySecureShell project.
This stack will be used to build packages in destination of upstream Linux distribution packages. But I&amp;rsquo;d like to provide a simpler and faster way to create custom repositories mainly for Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS and Fedora. In addition if packages could be automatically created when a new tag is pushed to the GitHub account, it would be perfect.</description>

      <description>You may know that I&amp;rsquo;m one of the 2 founders of MySecureShell. Around 6 years ago, we made a quick try to send MySecureShell to Debian and didn&amp;rsquo;t make enough efforts to make it possible.
This time I worked hard to make this happen. Thanks a lot to Gonéri Le bouder, a colleague and Debian dev to make it possible and helped me to do it fast, before Jessie freeze.</description>

      <title>Finally: switching back to iOS (from Android)</title>

      <description>In previous posts, I talked about why I switched from iOS to Android.
After 1 year and a half, after 3 different Android phones (Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Samsung Galaxy S5), I&amp;rsquo;m finally going to switch back to iOS. For several reasons in facts but the major ones are those:
 Application quality lower than on iOS Lower global stability on Samsung Touchwizz and Cyanogen  I was pretty happy with Google Stock ROM, however it&amp;rsquo;s not available on all devices and the Nexus do not have the better hardware (not talking about Nexus 6).</description>

      <description>You may upgrade your Mac OS X version to Yosemite (10.10) and saw you dual boot with Linux not working anymore :-(.
That&amp;rsquo;s because Apple made changes and Refind is not yet ready for it. So here is the solution to get your dual boot half back. It won&amp;rsquo;t fully work as expected, but you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to boot to Linux with Refind and Mac OS X with the alt key.</description>

      <description>I recently had a gift, this is a connected strap, the Jawbone UP24 model. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t do a lot of things, but what it does works well.
I wanted one with a good autonomy. And a recent firmware update grew from 7 days to 14 the number of days the battery autonomy. I also wanted a strap able to give me information on night I&amp;rsquo;ve spent, doesn&amp;rsquo;t let me sleep all the afternoon during a siesta.</description>

      <description>A colleague talked to me about this tool this week and I felt in love. It helps to easily navigate into your git repository. You can have a look on last log and directly in the same interface the diff of the current commit. I&amp;rsquo;ve attached one screenshot to let you see how cool it is.
The are also a lot of other features but just for browsing purpose. You can&amp;rsquo;t update or make changes.</description>

      <description>Fig is a fast, isolated development environments using Docker. For some features, it can be compared to Vagrant where the Dockerfike is not enough powerful to build multiple instances.
For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to test a new product version of a software like MediaWiki and you want to build the complete stack. So you may need to have several tools categories (depending of the usage):
 Web: Nginx, PHP-FPM, Varnish App Cahing: Redis Search: ElasticSearch  In Vagrant you can natively build 3 VM and interconnect them without the need of additional tool.</description>

      <description>I recently discover Aptly which permit to manage local Debian repositories. I waited this kind of tools during several years and now I&amp;rsquo;m really happy.
It is able to manage several repositories, making snapshots, merging snapshots, diff between 2 snapshots, filtering packages to avoid downloading unwanted ones&amp;hellip;.
This is perfect when you want to test before upgrading a critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>One of my ex-boss talked to me about Coursera a year ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a website where you can freely learn several things from high graduated school. Most ofter, it&amp;rsquo;s technology related and I wanted to test it to learn Java.
I subscribed to 2 sessions. One for the java basics and the other one for the object oriented aspect (in french). I&amp;rsquo;ve started it a few weeks ago the first part and what I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very good.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/10/08/galera-innoptimizer-now-support-tables-partition/</guid>
      <description>You may remember the first introduction of that tool here. I&amp;rsquo;ve made changes to support tables&amp;rsquo; partition, to avoid a big lock on huge tables.
The solution is to rebuild every partition one by one instead of rebuilding the whole table. This is smoother and less stressing Galera. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this new version (v0.2).
Note: I still got issues on MariaDB 10 with such thing, I&amp;rsquo;m working on it.</description>

      <description>The first thing you generally want to do when you have any new Storage system like SSD, Disk arrays or a Cluster Ceph, is benching. You will want to know how can read and write throughput. FIO is able to do that for you, here is an example:
[global] ioengine=libaio invalidate=1 ramp_time=5 direct=1 size=5G runtime=300 time_based directory=/home [seq-read] rw=read bs=64K stonewall [rand-read] rw=randread bs=4K stonewall [seq-write] rw=write bs=64K stonewall [rand-write] rw=randwrite bs=4K stonewall  You then will have a good output of everything you need to know.</description>

      <description>Cyanogen is finally available on Sumsung Galaxy S5 Europe (klte) :-). Thanks Cyanogen Team! For the moment, you can only grab nighly builds but everything is working fine on it.
Regarding the difference with the Samsung ROM, I noticed the battery life time is a little bit reduced (up to 15% depending on your usage). Camera is working fine, calls, screen etc&amp;hellip; are ok too. I only have minor bugs that I don&amp;rsquo;t really care in fact.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about things that may frustrate you with Sphinxdoc and ReadTheDocs. ReadTheDocs has a beautiful theme and you certainly want to use it with Sphinxdoc. However the size of the main text may be too small for you. Or you noticed that when you try to generate a version locally you&amp;rsquo;ll see it works like a charm but when it&amp;rsquo;s compiled on Readthedocs, it will fail.
Here is a solution on how to make it work both locally and on Readthedocs:</description>

      <description>I already heard of Sphinxdoc a year ago and see some of my colleges are using it for professional or personal usages. With my friend Sebastien Tardif (Teka101), we decided to rebuild a complete documentation for MySecureShell in a more fashion way as the old doculentation starts looking ugly. Even if it&amp;rsquo;s more an oriented Python solution, it can be used for any other kind of project and we decided to use SphinxDoc to make a newer documentation.</description>

# HSTS (force users to come in SSL if they&amp;#39;ve already been once) add_header Strict-Transport-Security &amp;quot;max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains&amp;quot;;  If you want to have an overview of a complete configuration with it, look at the my wiki.</description>

      <description>Because of the recent announce from DotDeb about PHP 5.6 availability on Debian, I saw that I totally forgot to move from PHP 5.4 to 5.5.
As I&amp;rsquo;m hosting several WordPress, Mediawiki, Piwik and other PHP web software, I was not very comfortable with that migration. I knew that the major change was on PHP cache. I was intensively using APC cache but in PHP 5.5, it is deprecated and Opcache replace it.</description>

 Does not retain some default preferences Forget to make some thumbnails when importing a lot of photos in several albums etc&amp;hellip;  I tested AWS backups and even if the price is correct, it&amp;rsquo;s too slow for restoring in my opinion.</description>

I decided to adapt those rules to block bruteforce login attack for WordPress. The problem is WordPress is not returning 403 error code when a user fail to logon but return a 200 instead :-/.</description>

Neo4j is a highly scalable, robust (fully ACID) native graph database. Neo4j is used in mission-critical apps by thousands of leading startups, enterprises, and governments around the world.
I you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is a graph database, it&amp;rsquo;s a very good introduction and will help you to understand what it is and how it works.</description>

      <description>I recently wanted to update my Vagrant box running Debian Wheezy. The problem is, the box size is growing on each updates for several reasons. And I prefer to create a new box from scratch on any new Debian release.
Starting from scratch each time is a little bit boring, that&amp;rsquo;s why I created a preseed file (french). That made the install automatically, however I always had to do other step by hands (or need to write a script for it).</description>

Regarding the CPU side, I do not have an easy answer for the moment :-(. However regarding the memory, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a Nagios/Naemon check which will check the memory (RAM) and SWAP of a container. Here is how to use it:</description>

      <description>For several years, I was wondering how to make Mediawiki search case insensitive. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really had time to look at it until I was really fed up. That&amp;rsquo;s why after a few seconds of search, I&amp;rsquo;ve found an extension for Mediawiki which is working perfectly called TitleKey.
 The TitleKey extension provides a case-insensitive title prefix search. It uses a separate table for the keys, so if it works cleanly it can be deployed without an expensive rebuild of core tables, and dumped when Wikimedia gets a nicer backend through Extension:LuceneSearch (pre 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using for my own servers LXC for about a year now. I&amp;rsquo;m still fed up about bugs introduced by the beta version of LXC (0.8b) present in Debian Wheezy. As now LXC project has released a stable version, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at the Debian backports, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have any chance to find a newer version on it :-(. However, a version 1.0.4 exist on Debian Jessie. I took the Debian sources and recompiled them on Wheezy (available here).</description>

      <description>Thanks to Free Mobile (French mobile provider) to provides an SMS API. I enabled it for my own monitoring escalation, just in case I have problem receiving emails.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a short documentation on how to setup SMS notification through Free Mobile for Nagios or Naemon (in french).

      <title>Monitoring: switching from Nagios to Naemon (not Shinken or Sensu)</title>

      <description>I am using Nagios for about 8 years now for personal and professional usage. What I can say is, this is a super product, old and stable but not as scalable as I would like. We&amp;rsquo;re in the age of Cloud computing and in my opinion we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to take care about backup and monitoring in now days, this should be automatic.
I was searching a solution for my personal usages, that&amp;rsquo;s why I first wanted a lightweight solution but with enough maturity to auto discover my newly created LXC containers.</description>

      <description>I recently talked about Gogs and really like this solution. The main problem I encounter was the current stable version which may not be usable on Debian.
Here is a quick solution to make it work. First of all, install git:
apt-get install git  Then you can download the latest compiled version directly from gobuild.
wget http://gobuild.io/github.com/gogits/gogs/master/linux/amd64 -O output.zip unzip output.zip ./start.sh  You can now access to port 3000.</description>

      <description>I was using Gitweb for about 3 years now and wanted to have a more enhanced web version. I started to look at 3 solutions for my own needs. So my comparison is for my own usage with 2 or 3 friends at max and not for enterprise:
 GitHub: can make free public and paid private repositories. Sounds very good, the most powerful solution of the market in my opinion.</description>

It will help you to start with ElasticSearch and answer a lot of question you may have regarding the product. If you want to buy it, take a look there.</description>

      <description>During the last weeks I started to play with Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana. I made a documentation to help on deploying it easily.
As you may know, I&amp;rsquo;m an Ansible fan, so I made Ansible playbooks to deploy a complete infrastructure (server and clients). They will deploy this kind of architecture:
On the client side, Fluentd clients will get syslog and Nginx logs, to send them to the Fluentd server. On the server side, a Fluentd receiver will be there to get data from other Fluentd clients.</description>

You may now be happy to know that I&amp;rsquo;ve made an Ansible playbook for Fluentd as well. If you still don&amp;rsquo;t see what those tree ansible playbook can do when they are combined together, you&amp;rsquo;ll see in the next post :-)</description>

You can find my Kibana playbook on GitHub.

      <description>My use case is specific but not isolated. When I&amp;rsquo;m at work, I&amp;rsquo;m connected to my VPN at home. I have a specific DNS at home for my domain in deimos.lan and this is very useful to avoid me to remind all the IP of the services I have.
Sometimes, I want to connect to a home service from the VPN, but my bookmarked links have my home DNS which are unknown from the DNS at work.</description>

      <description>Ubiquiti brings software that are easy to install on Windows and Mac OS. However as it is strongly recommended to let this software always up, it&amp;rsquo;s preferable to have a Linux version to run it in a container or a virtual machine. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to install it for a powerstrip mPower on Debian inside LXC.
The documentation is very poor, that&amp;rsquo;s why I made this one for those who want to do like me.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to test and switch to FreeBSD. Which one I forgot to upgrade since a while and I decided to do it to see if it&amp;rsquo;s the same nightmare I encountered on OpenBSD.
I was surprised by the simplicity of the upgrade and how things happens without any issues.</description>

I really like Seafile even if a search feature is missing :-(. Seafile client is unfortunately not an available solution on all software proposing a cloud connection for sharing files.
Hopefully an alternative exists using Webdav protocol. It is not activated by default on Seafile but can easily be enable. Here is how to do it.</description>

Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager.  And hopefully I found very good documentations on Internet (and especially on Arch wiki). I&amp;rsquo;ve made a summary on my wiki if you want to know how to diagnose a Systemd issue.</description>

 Docker 1.0: this is the first stable version after more than one year of development. This version is production ready and I will start using it asap.

We&amp;rsquo;re in fact waiting on a lot of work on the kernel side or systemd side. More information&amp;rsquo;s can be found here. Another solution that permit to bind a socks inside containers exists called CGManager, however classical tools doesn&amp;rsquo;t use it to get informations.</description>

No major visual changes between the previous version 1.22 and this one. I didn&amp;rsquo;t had to touch anything on my JS, CSS or configuration! Great!
I encountered an issue with my GoogleSearch extension and made the changes to make it work again. So a new version (0.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m already using LXC on my home server and see the benefits for 8 months ago. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to migrate this server to LXC as well. The difference here is that I wanted to migrate my VM from KVM. All my KVM VM are on Debian Wheezy so that was pretty easy.</description>

      <description>Luc (@lstep) informed me about an interesting software that looks like Juju at first and I wanted to share it with you. It&amp;rsquo;s called Gaudi.
 If you already use Docker to setup your dev box for large applications, don&amp;rsquo;t you suffer to maintain complex Dockerfiles?
Splitting a service Oriented Architecture into several Docker containers is the solution, except managing links and mounts between them is a pain. gaudi solves that by offering a way to describe a system of Docker containers using a simple DSL.</description>

Originally delivered as a proprietary dashboard included with Inktank Ceph Enterprise, Calamari has some really great visualization stuff for your cluster as well as the long term goal of being the all-in-wonder management system that can configure and analyze a Ceph cluster.
Calamari is composed in 2 elements:
 Backend: the Calamari backend is written in Python 2.6+, using Saltstack, ZeroRPC, gevent, Django, django-rest-framework, graphite, (and a few others I may have forgotten) and instantiates a new REST API for integration with other systems.</description>

      <description>I started to play with Ansible a little bit more than a week ago and I really enjoy it compared to Puppet. I still do not have all my reflex that I can have on Puppet, however what I can say is how easy it is to start making complicated things on Ansible!
I started to rewrite my Puppet manifests to Ansible playbooks and what I can say is it&amp;rsquo;s really fast and easy.</description>

      <description>Regarding one of my latest post, talking about Fluentd, some of you asked me why I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Fluentd instead of Logstash. First of all, I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at this blog post, which kindly resume the current situation. Looking at this and with feedback I got, I could establish this array:
   Logstash  Fluentd   Concerns  Flexibility/Interoperability  Simplicity/Robustness   Language  JRuby  Cruby   Inputs  More  Fewer   Inputs specs  Basics  Scalables   Plugins  Lot  Lot more   Plugins install  Simple (drop a jar)  Can be complex (dependencies)   Logs send crypt  Yes  Yes   Scalability  Forward to 2 hosts  LB A/A or A/P   Reliability  Can loss messages  No message loss    Logstash and Fluentd are both powerful solutions, they both got pros and cons.</description>

      <description>Next Wednesday, a meetup will take place in Paris talking about Elasticsearch. My previous post was talking about a log solution using Elasticsearch.
During that meetup, an overview of how Elasticsearch powerful real-time capabilities enrich Hadoop development. The session will showcase how to perform real-time searches on top and within Hadoop, Hive, Pig or Cascading jobs to get better answers, fast.
We&amp;rsquo;ll cover architectural topics such as index scalability, data locality and partitioning between the Hadoop cluster and the search index, using off and on-premise storages (HDFS, S3, local file-systems) and multi-tenancy.</description>

      <description>Managing logs is not a complicated tasks with classical syslog systems (syslog-ng, rsyslog&amp;hellip;). However, being able to search in them quickly when you have several gigabit of logs, with scalability, with a nice graphical interface etc&amp;hellip;is not the same thing.
Hopefully today, tools that permit to do it very well exists, here are the list of tools that&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;re going to use to achieve it:
 Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch is a flexible and powerful open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine.</description>

 The mysqlnd library is highly optimized for and tightly integrated into PHP. The MySQL Client Library cannot offer the same optimizations because it is a general-purpose client library.</description>

      <description>My last post was about existing alternatives to Dropbox. I also mentioned that I was trying Seafile.
I&amp;rsquo;m running now Seafile since a few days now and it works without any issues. The Linux and Android clients works very well. I just hope a sync feature in the Android version will appear. Regarding the web version, there are all attending collaboration features and that&amp;rsquo;s great. Seafile supports file versioning and trash bin.</description>

      <description>Recently a new person as joined the administration of Dropbox called Condoleezza Rice. The problem is: this person is known to have allowed phone tapping in the US. So should be thrust in Dropbox anymore ?
For me not really. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to look at alternatives. I already tested Owncloud but was plenty of bugs. Also a french post about that situation has been made.
I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at alternatives and Seafile looks like the best alternative to Dropbox and Owncloud.</description>

      <description>The Percona replication manager (PRM) is a framework using the Linux HA resource agent Pacemaker that manages replication and provides automatic failover. This covers the installation of the framework on a set of servers. The PRM framework is made of 4 components: Corosync, Pacemaker, the mysql resource agent and MySQL itself.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to setup, better if you already know how to use Pacemaker and it works like a charm. In fact it setup a master and x slaves.</description>

Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too much resources. You can use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes.</description>

After researches, it looked like that i3blocks it the best alternative. So I contacted the creator (Vivien) and had very good exchanges with him.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made pull requests and suggestions to integrate missing checks, faster one that I developed and with colorization depending of the contexts.</description>

First of all, I had to be in recovery mod (bottom button + vol up + power). Then I wanted to create a /sdcard but it didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mount and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to format my sdcard. So I mounted a tmpfs onto it:</description>

      <description>NAXSI means Nginx Anti Xss &amp;amp; Sql Injection. Technically, it is a third party nginx module, available as a package for many UNIX-like platforms. This module, by default, reads a small subset of simple rules (naxsi_core.rules) containing 99% of known patterns involved in websites vulnerabilities. For example, &amp;lsquo;&amp;lt; &amp;lsquo;, &amp;lsquo;|&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;drop&amp;rsquo; are not supposed to be part of a URI.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while that I wanted to test NAXSI and it seams working not so bad.</description>

      <description>As you may read, I recently decided to drop Cyanogen :-(. Google Now interface is fine, but not enough user oriented for now days in my opinion. A few months ago, a friend (@sebastien_han) show me Aviate and switched to it. This is an interface that helps you day to day to show you informations and apps you need depending on your localization. I really love it!
Last week I discovered Cover which is a solution for the lockscreen.</description>

      <description>In France, we have the chance to have an ISP/Mobile Telephony provider called Free. They considerably reduced the market price for the Mobile phone communications in 2012. This was very fine for competition and for French people. Now we can have correct prices for Internet and cell phone data. Thanks to Free.
Ceph is quite the same as Free but for storage systems. Since many years, disks array constructors sold us locked solutions with a very high cost of hardware and licenses&amp;rsquo; software.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to make a new test with it and it&amp;rsquo;s now adopted. I spent a little bit time on reconfiguring all my needs (workspaces depending my screen configuration, opening app on a defined workspace, keyboard bindings etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

When I switched to Nexus 4, it was not too bad, but I sometimes had problems on updates that forced me to restore.</description>

 Replication  MariaDB 10 sets a new standard in performance. It is many times faster than previous generations of MariaDB and especially legacy database MySQL thanks to new features including parallel replication and a further advanced group commit. Also, the replication slaves are now crash-safe. It’s also now possible to replicate data from multiple master servers giving a complete view of the distributed data across big datasets for real-time analytical purposes via the multi-source replication feature.</description>

      <description>One of my colleague (Julien Danjou) wrote a book on advanced usage of Python. The book was out today and I strongly recommend buying it. Here is the summary of it:
 Python is a wonderful programming language that is being used more and more in many different industries. It is fast, flexible, and it comes with batteries included.
Most of the books you read about Python will teach you the language basics – but once you&amp;rsquo;ve learnt them, you’re on your own in designing your application and discovering best practice.</description>

      <description>If you want to easily build a static webpage with parallax effect, you can try the Cool Kitten framework. It is a young project that already have cool stuffs like grids solution, responsive design etc&amp;hellip;It uses Normalize.css, jQuery Easing Plugin and Stellar.js.
You need nodejs to minify CSS but do not need nodejs server to run it, as it is static HTML pages.
In a few days, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you my usage.</description>

      <description>A meetup on Ansible and SaltStack will take place in Paris next Monday. It unfortunately has not been initiated on the traditional meet up website and you may missed it like me.
So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested by those two configuration tool outsiders, follow the link. Both tools are written in Python, that why it is a Python meetup at first.
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to participate to the meetup as this is the first one, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll learn interesting things on it and meet new faces :-)</description>

      <description>Packer is a tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. You can win a lot of time by testing your application on multiple environments (AWS, OpenStack, VirtualBox, Vmware&amp;hellip;).
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve got a LAMP environment to deploy in production on OpenStack. However, you can&amp;rsquo;t perform your development/integration on it as you don&amp;rsquo;t have access yet. You can&amp;rsquo;t loose time and wait for it to test.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/03/14/postfix-limit-outgoing-mail-throttling/</guid>
      <description>When you have a huge amount of mail to deliver, you can&amp;rsquo;t release the queue at once and let the server maximize the outgoing mail throughput ! The result will be: you&amp;rsquo;ll get blacklisted from a lot of MX servers.
That&amp;rsquo;s why you should take care of it and do traffic shaping. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little tips on it.</description>

      <description>The 1.5 version of Vagrant has been released and that&amp;rsquo;s awesome ! They finally did a Cloud where all Vagrant boxes could (https://vagrantcloud.com/) be inventoried and easily deployed through command line !
You can find my boxes here. If you want to add one, it&amp;rsquo;s really simple:
vagrant box add deimosfr/debian-wheezy  And the second awesome feature is&amp;hellip;the sharing! You can for example have access to a distant and nated Vagrant instance through SSH!</description>

      <description>I recently played with HAProxy and discovered that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made a documentation regarding this fantastic software. So if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what HAProxy is, it&amp;rsquo;s a load balancer working on layer 7 and specialized for http protocol.
It is able to handle sticky sessions which is really powerful. More than that, it has a small footprint and can work under a high load traffic.
Here is my documentation.</description>

      <title>Easily deploy Ceph Cluster with Ansible</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/03/06/ceph-deploy-it-with-ansible/</guid>
      <description>One of my colleague (Sebastien Han) started to play (like me) with Ansible. As he is a Ceph master, he often deploy Ceph for tests or production. He generally uses Puppet for that purpose.
But due to some Puppet limitations or big brain fuck it involves, he started to play with Ansible and created a Ceph module for it. He showed me it, when he was writing it and it seamed working like a charm.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while now that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of Ansible but I only started playing with a week ago. You may certainly know that I&amp;rsquo;m a Puppet lover, but this solution is more powerful than Puppet in my opinion.
So I started to migrate my personal Puppet to Ansible just to play with. Here are the pros:
 No client needed on the clients, only SSH! It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python By default a lot of modules Not only a configuration management tool, it&amp;rsquo;s an orchestrator too!</description>

      <description>If you already played with Puppet&amp;rsquo;s environments, you certainly know that the major problem is the static form of them. When you want to test something new (a module for example), it&amp;rsquo;s not quite easy without using environments. r10k bring the dynamic feature and easy module managment !
It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to maintain your modules without using a lot of git submodules. Simply declare your modules informations like that:
mod &amp;#39;filemapper&amp;#39;, :git =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;git://github.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered a Vagrant plugin that manage the VirtualBox Guest Additions automatically. I mean, when you launch a virtual machine, it automatically checks if the Guest Additions are installed. If it&amp;rsquo;s not the case or if they are not up to date, installation of the latest version is made automatically !
Here is how to install it.</description>

      <description>Several persons asked me how could they do slides like I did with MySQL/MariaDB for example. I mentioned that I used LaTeX with Beamer and they were all frighten by the technology and language (takes too long time to be able to use it).
I think that&amp;rsquo;s not totally wrong but once you&amp;rsquo;ve understand how it works&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s fantastic. So for colleagues and friends, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation on how to use beamer and provided a template to get a quick start on it.</description>

      <description>Big resolution with small screens is more and more common and we&amp;rsquo;re facing a problem on fonts visualization as the readability is not optimal. We have a lot of non adapted fonts for retina display, even if most of them are not so bad. The solution to resolve that problem is to install additional fonts to replace the default one. And one of the best one I&amp;rsquo;ve seen is Infinality fonts !</description>

      <description>Yesterday a colleague (Dimitri) tested a tool on this blog. He informed me that Varnish was disabled and PageSpeed may be the cause as this is the last modification I&amp;rsquo;ve made on the server.
After verification he was totally right ! By default, PageSpeed disable cache by serving HTML files with:
Cache-Control: no-cache, max-age=0  After reading the PageSpeed documentation on that topic, it is clear: PageSpeed needs to know how to purge the cache as it rewrites a lot of elements and it has the control instead of the application.</description>

      <description>Following a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve enabled PageSpeed on both wiki and blog deimos.fr.
What I can say is, it&amp;rsquo;s very important to take the time to test every optimizations you want to add. I experienced for example issues on silly things like :
# Optimize browser rendering pagespeed EnableFilters lazyload_images;  Some images weren&amp;rsquo;t shown if you didn&amp;rsquo;t refresh once again your page browser. I only had this problem on the blog and not the wiki.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve first heard of Page Speed last year for Apache. I was really waiting a stable version for Nginx and it&amp;rsquo;s now done. A few days ago, Nicolargo made a post regarding it and that&amp;rsquo;s what motivated me to go ahead on Page Speed.
PageSpeed speeds up your site and reduces page load time. This open-source webserver module automatically applies web performance best practices to pages and associated assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) without requiring that you modify your existing content or workflow.</description>

First of all, I started with a MySQL Performance Schema presentation :
http://dimitrik.free.fr/mysqltechday_2013_10/MySQL_PFS_2013-dim.pdf
I saw that I had underestimated the power of Performance schema ! We can for example see iowaits and waiting time on tables files.</description>

When I was working for Linagora, I gave a training on advanced usage on MySQL/MariaDB. Unfortunately there weren&amp;rsquo;t slides on that subject at this moment and I had to make them all. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did and made an unbranded version for me as well.</description>

      <description>I already talked about nftables and it has now been implemented in the 3.13 kernel !
For those who never heard of that, it&amp;rsquo;s a kernel built in replacement of iptables. All features are not there yet but should be implemented in 3.15.
If you like Packet Filter, you&amp;rsquo;ll be happy. If you&amp;rsquo;re not sure of the advantages of it, simply read that short comparison and you&amp;rsquo;ll be convinced : https://home.</description>

      <title>Offloading SSL with Nginx and Varnish</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/23/offloading-ssl-with-nginx-and-varnish/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/23/offloading-ssl-with-nginx-and-varnish/</guid>
      <description>Varnish is a real powerful cache solution for web servers. He is unfortunately not able to do it over SSL. Anyway, there is a solution by offloading it with Nginx. Here is a schema to get a better understanding :
Nginx decrypt SSL, pass it in clear to Varnish. If Varnish got it, replies to Nginx which crypt back data to send to user.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made a full documentation to get it working well, follow the link.</description>

      <title>Ceph: setup Rados Block Devices (RBD) nodes on Debian</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/21/ceph-setup-block-devices-rbd-nodes-on-debian/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/21/ceph-setup-block-devices-rbd-nodes-on-debian/</guid>
      <description>In addition of object storage, Ceph is able to provide block devices. Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD) provides access to block device images that are striped and replicated across the entire storage cluster.
For example this is used to store Virtual Machines on OpenStack. With that solution, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a real fault tolerance system for your VM and distributed.
The RBD part is an easy task when you&amp;rsquo;ve already setup a Ceph cluster.</description>

      <title>CloudFlare : testing a free CDN</title>

      <description>CloudFlare is a Free solution to load your website faster and add security. I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it 2 days ago, that&amp;rsquo;s why you may experienced issues in accessing the blog and wiki.
I had issues on WordPress, so I need to correct some problems relating images (http/https) as the Free version of CloudFlare doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SSL. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve roll back for the moment.
I have other kind of modifications to make on WordPress before it works as it should.</description>

      <title>Ceph: setup Objects Storage (OSD) nodes on Debian</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/15/ceph-setup-objects-storage-osd-nodes-on-debian/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/15/ceph-setup-objects-storage-osd-nodes-on-debian/</guid>
      <description>Following the previous post, on Ceph Storage, I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation with informations to play with OSD. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered :
 Setup OSD Remove OSD Use Ceph Ojects Storage  Using the object storage system is not complicated and easily scalable. It&amp;rsquo;s a real pleasure to work with that kind of solutions. If you&amp;rsquo;re already working with other objects storage solutions, you won&amp;rsquo;t be lost.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/01/13/ceph-installation-and-configuration-on-debian/</guid>
      <description>I finally started to play with Ceph to add it in production. I&amp;rsquo;m still impressed by this storage solution. Just to remind, Ceph is an open-source, massively scalable, software-defined storage system which provides object, block and file system storage (not yet ready for production usage) in a single platform. It runs on commodity hardware-saving you costs, giving you flexibility. And as it’s in the Linux kernel, it’s easy to consume.</description>

      <description>Cgroups permit to restrict a process to specific hardware like CPU or limiting IO disk etc&amp;hellip; Managing it manually could be a nightmare and hopefully, a good workaround exists.
It&amp;rsquo;s called cgconfig and allows you to have a running daemon to apply restrictions on all new running process. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a documentation for it and spent time on it as it&amp;rsquo;s not properly Debian packaged yet :-(</description>

      <description>Piwik 2.0 has been released a few days ago. The upgrade of my version was done without any issues (as a rule with Piwik).
I like the look of this new version and like the new mobile application on Android. It&amp;rsquo;s really better organized and really looks like as an application (compared with the first version).
There are some new interesting features for professionals (not for my personal usage).
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good alternative to Google Analytics and you should try it.</description>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/12/30/android-avoid-media-to-be-scanned/</guid>
      <description>On android, you may need some folder to no being indexed. It could be photos or videos&amp;hellip;
To do so, use a ES Explorer for example and a &amp;lsquo;.nomedia&amp;rsquo; file inside the desired folder.
No index will be done in that folder. I like to do it when I temporary add TV series and don&amp;rsquo;t want them to be indexed. By this way I don&amp;rsquo;t see them in the Gallery application for example.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to set a website in maintenance and wanted to do it as quickly as possible with any restart of Nginx.
The idea is to add a maintenance.html page at the root of your web folder and then the maintenance page is automatically taken into account.
To do it, simply follow the link (in french).</description>

      <description>In those time, security is more and more important. Some vulnerabilities have been discovered and security on your SSL should be added. In fact you need to restrict the possibilities to your SSL server to avoid SSL breaks.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation to add SSL Resumption and authorized ciphers algorithms.
Then you can check your SSL server security here : https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html.
I hope this will help you.</description>

      <description>Once again, I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded my wiki (wiki.deimos.fr) and it was really easy with git.
We could see some new minor design changes like &amp;ldquo;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo; banners or the login page. Other interesting features are appearing like load time informations for each page edition or embedding Vector theme in the Core. A new extension manager is used called Composer and will try to look at it&amp;rsquo;s benefits shortly.
Once again, thanks Mediawiki !</description>

      <title>LXC : use dnsmasq instead of libvirt</title>
      <link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/11/28/lxc-use-dnsmasq-instead-of-libvirt/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2013/11/28/lxc-use-dnsmasq-instead-of-libvirt/</guid>
      <description>LXC is a really good container solution to replace older container solutions like OpenVZ or Vserver for instance. Libvirt is a wonderful tool to manage different hypervisors and containers solutions. Anyway Libvirt is unfortunately not able to fully manage LXC (create, delete&amp;hellip;) today.
That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to get it running and installed on a server, but it could be useful if you have KVM and LXC working on the same machine to get the same tool to handle start/stop containers/VMs.</description>

      <description>A friend recently introduced me nice Bootstrap themes. I tested some of them really simply and like the concept. I&amp;rsquo;m in fact surprised that it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been done before in a so professional way.
To see them, look at bootswatch website : http://bootswatch.com/</description>

mysql -u&amp;lt;user&amp;gt; -p&amp;lt;password&amp;gt; --one-database &amp;lt;database_name&amp;gt; &amp;lt; backup-`date +%y%m%d`.sql  I&amp;rsquo;ve added it to my wiki as well.

So I have bought the 32G and will be happy to get the photo stabilizer. Those are the major enhancement that makes me take the new Nexus.
I&amp;rsquo;m waiting the Cyanogen ROM to get all advanced features I like and hope it will be available soon.</description>

      <description>The lego calendar is a wall mounted time planner that we invented for our studio. It’s made entirely of lego, but if you take a photo of it with a smartphone all of the events and timings will be magically synchronised to an online, digital calendar. It makes the most of the tangibility of physical objects, and the ubiquity of digital platforms, and it’s also puts a smile on our faces when we use it!</description>

      <description>Redshift adjusts the color temperature of your screen according to your surroundings. This may help your eyes hurt less if you are working in front of the screen at night.
Two of my colleagues (Julien and Axel) praise virtues of this application. So I started to use it yesterday. For the moment, my opinion is good during the night, but during the day&amp;hellip;I don&amp;rsquo;t have opinion for the moment.
Here is my configuration.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve reinstalled my desktop on my new MacBook Pro 13, I had to fight with some problems with my Yubikey. I never had such and wonder if it couldn&amp;rsquo;t comes from a Debian package update.
Anyway, I had problem with permissions on the USB device and found a udev solution. I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation and let you check and would like a feedback if some of you have encountered the same issue (USB error: Access denied (insufficient permissions))</description>

      <description>Galera uses a preallocated file with a specific size called gcache, used to store the writesets in circular buffer style. By default, its size is 128MB and it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to upgrade it to a higher value.
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my documentation on that if you want to check. In addition, you can find more informations, I suggest a Severalnines link.</description>

      <description>This is not a really good news. An announcement at OSMC (Open Source Monitoring Conference) as been made by Andreas Ericsson ( Nagios 4 core dev) about the future of Nagios.
Nagios 4 is the latest Core version of the project ! Only the enterprise version will remain (strategic choice of Ethan, the creator).
A Nagios 4 fork will appear called Naemon and developed by Andreas Ericsson. I remind as well that the Shinken is a real good alternative and is able to work with your current Nagios configuration.</description>

      <description>I recently crypted all my disk as I changed laptop. At the beginning, I just tested a simple password to see performances changes.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t really see changes for the moment.
Once I&amp;rsquo;ve finished to install and configure my needs, I wanted to have a strong password solution. I decided to use a remembered password concatenated to a generated yubikey password.
I updated my LUKS tutorial to explain how to update the password.</description>

      <description>I tested to install Debian as I love it more than Mac OS X for work on my new MacBook Pro 13 retina. Most of the hardware works out of the box on a Debian Jessie (because of the kernel version &amp;gt; 3.8) but is not really optimal. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I did to make it better.
First of all, you need an EFI manager. I discovered that Refit is not maintained anymore and let place to rEFInd instead.</description>

      <description>Yes I did it ! I finally switched from my fantastic Lenovo to the latest MacBook Pro 13.
Some of you won&amp;rsquo;t understand why I did it, but in fact you&amp;rsquo;ll see this is an evidence. What was the problem with the Lenovo ? Just the weight ! I&amp;rsquo;m usually transporting it from work to home and vice versa. I now have a backache and it couldn&amp;rsquo;t continue like that. Hopefully eNovance is a comprehensive company and allowed me to switch to another laptop of my choice.</description>

      <description>I finally found a tiling window manager for OS X and it&amp;rsquo;s free ! It&amp;rsquo;s called Xnomad and could be found on GiHub.
Easy to install, it gives the major features of a standard tiling window manager. This is a must have for me now on OS X.

      <description>Once again Mozilla made a future hit ! TogetherJS is a service you add to an existing website to add real-time collaboration features. Using the tool two or more visitors on a website or web application can see each other’s mouse/cursor position, clicks, track each other’s browsing, edit forms together, watch videos together, and chat via audio and WebRTC.
Plugins already exist for WordPress and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to integrate in any website :-).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to see my readers there and more than that if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t met this year. So save the date :-)</description>

      <description>Hi all,
This time, I&amp;rsquo;m asking help to find a good load testing tool. The one I know is Tsung but it&amp;rsquo;s not able to speak to some social API. I would like to know what kind of solution you are using and your feedback on it. I already played with Jmeter and I do not remind that it&amp;rsquo;s able to do better.
Any help is appreciated :-)
Thanks</description>

      <description>A little bit fed up about changing window manager to find the best one for my needs, after i3, I&amp;rsquo;m testing DWM.
I3 was really nice, but got too much limitation from my point of view. The configuration is too static while Awesome really flexible so the change was hard. An old colleague reminds me about DWM and gave me a real good feedback on it as he&amp;rsquo;s using it daily since a long time now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using Awesome WM for a few months and really like it&amp;rsquo;s modular LUA configuration file. But I encounter some little problems with window resizing that waste my time day to day and forced me to look at an alternative.
A colleague who encountered the same issue talked to Awesome creator (Julien Danjou) that I sometimes have the chance to see at eNovance. It looks like a complicated bug to resolve, he&amp;rsquo;s not the core maintainer anymore and as it will take too much time to resolve it, this bug shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fixed one day.</description>

      <description>Ceph is a high availability way to store your data. I really love that solution and how it works. It&amp;rsquo;s a real good alternative to high cost disks storage. With some colleges of eNovance, we&amp;rsquo;re currently participating to the Ceph Day today in London (http://www.inktank.com/CEPHdays/).
I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to be here, as I wanted to put in production Ceph, 4-5 years ago (when it was released as experimental in Linux Kernel).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been interested in NAS solutions as I&amp;rsquo;ve always made my own server and installed what I needed manually. In addition I always thought that it was closed sources since a friend show me I was wrong.
He definitively convinced me and I bought a Synology DS713+ last week. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to use, brings a lot of features and the biggest point : it&amp;rsquo;s an open system. I mean that you can have root access on a busy box and do what you want.</description>

      <description>Speaker Deck is the best way to share presentations online. Simply upload your slides as a PDF, and they will turn them into a beautiful online experience. View them on SpeakerDeck.com, or share them on any website with an embed code. More than that, it produces HTML 5 slides and there are no Ads :-)
I&amp;rsquo;m fed up about slideshare which doesn&amp;rsquo;t grow as it should be. They still produce flash slides and as many people, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it anymore.</description>

      <description>I recently made a script at work to act as a service when a pattern is found (or not) on a website. You can also run pre and post script if you want.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Windows binary that you can find on my GitHub or on my Git.
I did it in Perl. As described in the last post as I needed to have the interpreter embedded in the binary. I&amp;rsquo;m so bad to find good application name that I called it url_service_action.</description>

This time, I tried to reproduce the tips but encountered several issues. The first one was that error :
The locale codeset (cp1252) isn&amp;#39;t one that perl can decode, stopped at Encode/Locale.pm line 94.  It could simply be resolved by addressing &amp;lsquo;-x&amp;rsquo; parameter to the &amp;lsquo;pp&amp;rsquo; command line.</description>

In fact this is a simple shell script, but it really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re in a long subfolder list. For example if you reside in &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/src/org/main/site/utils/file/reader/whatever&amp;rsquo; and want to change to &amp;lsquo;/home/user/project/test&amp;rsquo;, then try &amp;lsquo;bd p`/test.
If you want to see all the possibilities, you can look at the main site project.</description>

      <description>I recently needed to install a simple translation tool that helps on follow the translation activity of a project. Pootle answered my requests very well and that&amp;rsquo;s why I created a documentation to deploy it. It&amp;rsquo;s written in Python and use Django.

      <description>As said in a previous post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to get Internet through FTTH (Fiber To The Home). Unfortunately I won&amp;rsquo;t get a fixed IP like I currently have with my ADSL provider.
It reminds me Internet 10 years before, when I needed to play with dyndns or no-ip to be able to connect to my house ISP. The story is now repeating but as I got real DNS instead, I need to send the modifications to my DNS Registrar instead.</description>

      <description>As you can see, I write more and more posts on LXC. The latest thing I worked on, was how to convert a host/vm to a LXC container. I needed to write a script for it as I didn&amp;rsquo;t find what I needed.
The script will remove unneeded elements in a Debian system, removing folders (dev,proc,sys), recreate devices and configure etc files. You can find more informations by following the link.</description>

I unfortunately have to leave Free for this year and hope I&amp;rsquo;ll could switch back to it in a year.
The bad news is I&amp;rsquo;ll have a random public IP :-(.</description>

      <description>What a topic ! It could sounds like a patent troll but let me explain why I posted it.
First of all, I do not have strong skills on Arch Linux, but so many people talked to me about it and have praised me the merit of that distribution that I absolutely needed to test it. Before, I was on Debian testing and had some setbacks that encouraged me to look ahead to find a better solution.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve write with emacs/vim or any other classical tool editor, a manifest or a Puppet module. If you did it, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of syntax errors or got errors during catalog compilation. During a long time, I was using Geppetto to help me on writing and suggesting better syntax to my manifest.
I took the latest available version of Geppetto but it crashes all the time.</description>

      <description>Awesome is still my window manager and I still love it. With my laptop, I need to be able to quickly get my working environment when I power it on. The major problem I had was to avoid having the same opened windows at boot if I&amp;rsquo;m in the train, at work or at home. Of course there is no GPS in the laptop to detect my location, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t set a rule for it.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t really play with Puppet since a long time and a lot of things have changed.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing a Puppet module for MySecureShell. And the thing is, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to quickly find the relevant information on how to build a module from scratch. I like to have experience return and what a chance when I saw a tweet regarding it, the same day as I started to write the module :-)</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m new to LXC, I am discovering how it works, see the maturity of the project and it&amp;rsquo;s integration in Debian. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a post a few weeks ago to introduce the basics and now I&amp;rsquo;m digging in advanced features.
I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered several issues. Most of them are not critical but unfortunately looks like a lack of integration on Debian.
 The first one is related to wheezy template and I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about it in a previous post.</description>

I like this repository as it&amp;rsquo;s updated faster than the Debian one and you can have the latest version of some packages. Of course you can do package pinning if you only want one or a set of packages.
You can access to the repository here : http://www.dotdeb.org/</description>

      <description>Glances is a cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool written in Python.
It avoids to run several tools to get a all in one overview of your system. For example, when you want to quickly see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong on a system for diagnosis, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to launch top/htop, iostat, vmstat&amp;hellip;Glances gives you a large overview of your system health.
You can then investigate with the appropriate tool if you want. But you didn&amp;rsquo;t waste your time in opening several tools to get the first desired information : where does the problem comes from ?</description>

      <description>The goal of this documentation is how to quickly setup a monitoring screen machine for Nagios/Shinken. Several times in several company I had to do that kind of thing. On Mac OS and Linux.
I finished to create a documentation for the next times I&amp;rsquo;ll have to deploy such things. The idea is to have a machine that nobody never touch once installed. It&amp;rsquo;s always boring to plug a keyboard and a mouse when somethings goes wrong on this kind of machine that you normally never have to touch.</description>

      <description>This is not my first post on Beamer and not the first time I say I really like this piece of software.
As for LaTeX&amp;rsquo;s newbies it&amp;rsquo;s not really easy to start Beamer and as many people liked my last slides on MariaDB/MySQL. More than that, I had to make a presentation on DRBD at work and I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write it with Beamer.
My colleagues appreciated the look and LaTeX format.</description>

      <description>You certainly know and have used the default MediaWiki search. It&amp;rsquo;s quite good but it&amp;rsquo;s not an optimal search. I wanted to have better one for my wiki that&amp;rsquo;s why I added Google search some years ago.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to setup Apache Lucene or Apache Solar as both are in Java. I always heard good feedback about Sphinx, that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to add it at work and to my wiki as well.</description>

This feature is embedding videos without requesting additional extension and specific tags, it&amp;rsquo;s a built-in HTML5 media player. It was already possible to add videos but they weren&amp;rsquo;t playable directly on the page, it was a link.
As I manage the blog of my daughter, this is a really good news.</description>

How does PackStack works ? Some of you may tell me that DevStack do the same thing. But I warn once again about DevStack which is absolutely not build for production usages ! PackStack is a bundle of current modules for OpenStack available on Puppet Forge.</description>

      <description>Vagrant is a fast solution build on top of VirtualBox. I already talked about it in a previous post.
The thing is, you could do really more with Vagrant by adding Puppet manifests or Chef recipes in your Vagrant configuration file. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t often use one of those 2 softwares, it quickly could transform into a nightmare when they want to deploy softwares in addition of the OS.</description>

In addition, sometimes I need to set up a quick desktop environment with my preferences and deploy all I need may take a while. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve written some scripts (in Python and shell script) to help on deploying all my configuration and all the packages I wish.</description>

At the beginning of my tests, I unfortunately found an annoying bug which avoid performing correct Debian installation over LVM.
I tried to resolve it by myself but didn&amp;rsquo;t had enough time to finish my investigation. After quick searches, I found that other people found the bug on github : https://github.com/simonvanderveldt/lxc-debian-wheezy-template/issues/1#issuecomment-21303483
As a rule, I searched it on Debian bugs list but nothing was reported.</description>

I hope this will help some of you if problems occurs.</description>

      <description>Last week, I started to play with LXC. It is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtual system mechanism sometimes described as “chroot on steroids”.
LXC builds up from chroot to implement complete virtual systems, adding resource management and isolation mechanisms to Linux’s existing process management infrastructure.
I wanted to look at an alternative of OpenVZ and LXC seams to be the better solution. That&amp;rsquo;s why I started to play with.</description>

      <description>For more than 10 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen IBM/Lenovo laptops and I really wanted one to try. Every users I met with this kind of laptop always told me that they are very happy with, are robust and got Linux supported drivers.
As I always wanted to get Mac instead of PC for my personnel usages, I never bought one. And as most of time, enterprises prefer cheap Dell than any other expensive robust laptop, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t the chance to have a Lenovo till today.</description>

      <description>DRBD is an old stable solution to create block disk replications over the network. However in some case, we need to deal with failures for several reasons (hardware, network issues&amp;hellip;).
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my current documentation on this point and hope this will help some of you. You can find the update here.</description>

      <title>Vagrant : I finally dropped KVM for VirtualBox</title>

      <description>A few months ago, I wanted to install as fast as possible new VMs headless. In addition, I wanted to give the possibility for my ex colleagues to be able to easily create remote VMs on my desktop as most of them got slow machines. KVM did the job perfectly. I also needed to quickly deploy Debian, so I made a pressed file.
Here at eNovance, I can be selfish :-p as everybody got a fast machine (Thanks eNovance).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve bought 2 Yubikeys several months ago and didn&amp;rsquo;t really took the time to play with them.
A ex-colleague took that time and configured it on his desktop under ArchLinux. I decided to play with it, see how could it works and with his help, put it in place in a very short time.
I configured it to work in parallel of my password. With that configuration, I do not need anymore typing my password, but only need to plug in my Yubikey.</description>

      <description>Installing old Debian to prepare a migration is quite good when repositories are still available. But for old unmaintained versions of Debian, we need to change some things.
Hopefully Debian still keep all the old versions in an archive repository that is accessible by changing the default url. Even if during install it fails, you can set it up afterward.
I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a little article on it, follow the link.</description>

      <description>I tested some months ago TinyTiny RSS but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I expected from an RSS reader. That&amp;rsquo;s why, when Google announced their Reader&amp;rsquo;s end, I wanted to quickly find a reader that can fit my needs and have enough time to test it.
Fever answered most of them, instead of the mobile client. When I was on iPhone Reeder was nearly perfect, but not really Android with Meltdown.</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;ve took Gimp and modified a theme I liked. You can see the result :-)

      <description>For several years, I manually managed my MediaWiki instance manually and always upgraded manually, getting diffs, patching files etc&amp;hellip; Now it&amp;rsquo;s over, this method is simply not adapted to my needs.
Now, as MediaWiki use git, I decided to maintain my instance with the git repository and extensions as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve wrote a documentation on that :
 Installation method Core + extensions Upgrade core + extensions  &amp;nbsp;
I hope this will help some of you that still manage it by the old way.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently played with pkgin under NetBSD and searched to make it work under FreeBSD. Anyway it&amp;rsquo;s not really compatible. I saw old unmaintained version, but no one worked for me as expected :-(.
After a few searches, I found pkg2ng :-). That&amp;rsquo;s THE tool for FreeBSD. But unfortunately, as written in the wiki :
 As a consequence of the security incident on 11th November 2012, for the time being pre-compiled packages for pkgng are not available from any official FreeBSD repository.</description>

      <description>Selfoss is a self-hosted RSS reader solution. It could be compared to Tiny Tiny RSS or Feedly.
I liked to test that nice solution. But I&amp;rsquo;m still staying with Fever, as there is no Android version working with Selfoss (only an old one exist, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t work) and the web interface is a little bit slow (compared to Fever). I hope this will be better in a short term as this is the most elegant Open Source version I&amp;rsquo;ve tested for now.</description>

      <description>Beamer is a stable solution to make beautiful presentations with LateX. I recently used it and it&amp;rsquo;s amazing.
It&amp;rsquo;s the power of LateX with elegant presentations. The first time I saw it, was at FOSDEM this year (2013) and was surprised by the presentation quality.
Handling is a little bit long at first, but once done, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to think of what your slides should look and only need to concentrate on the content.</description>

Anyway even with new interface and features on iOS 7, there are still remaining work in comparison of Android. And what about new Apple features ?&amp;hellip; Not really relevant one :-(
I&amp;rsquo;ll test it later on my iPad but I&amp;rsquo;m still frustrated even if it&amp;rsquo;s better than the latests keynotes.</description>

The first time I tried, I was on a 2.x version of Android and a lot of missing features didn&amp;rsquo;t helped me to switch. My cell phone was a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I really can&amp;rsquo;t stand on Samsung Touchwizz layer. That why I decided to install a Mod called Cyanogen (you&amp;rsquo;ve certainly already have heard of this).</description>

In addition, I&amp;rsquo;ve modified my awesome configuration to get special music keys to work like a charm :-)</description>

For several months, I thinked to change my current one, but none really exited me. But this one is really, really cool. The touch feeling is really fine, additional button are nice (more would be great as well&amp;hellip;but it&amp;rsquo;s ok) and the must : input and output sound are directly on the keyboard, without any additional cables (all through USB :-)).</description>

      <description>When you manage outgoing emails through SMTP, you may sometimes need to test if a service is able to send correctly emails and itself check that there were no issue during sending. You can create a black hole for a specific domain and Postfix will answer from the same manner as if it is ok. It also permit to test Postfix sending capacities on a server.

      <title>Nginx Substitutions Filter : change of the fly page content</title>

      <description>Nginx Substitutions Filter is a filter module able to do both regular expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This module is quite different from the Nginx&amp;rsquo;s native Substitution Module. It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just like Apache&amp;rsquo;s mod_substitute.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played with the classic substitution module but due to limitations (only one matching pattern and no regex), it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to do all I wanted to do.</description>

      <description>It´s been a while that I was waiting for a tool that tells me if my Debian server is requesting a reboot or not. Of course GUI tools exists (like Ubuntu update-manager), but on a server machine, where there is no X server installed (thankfuly), this kind of CLI tools can be quickly interesting.
That´s why I wrote a tool called deb_reboot that gives the reboot requierement information in parsing postinstall scripts of installed packages.</description>

      <description>How could this happen ? I found a communication on that and it has simply been removed as there were no updates since a long time. Even if CVE were recently proposed, it&amp;rsquo;s considered as not enough :
http://debian.2.n7.nabble.com/Status-of-haproxy-for-upcoming-wheezy-release-td2907665.html
But guys ! Seriously, do you know how many people are using HAproxy ? It&amp;rsquo;s a shame that it&amp;rsquo;s not in the current stable version of Debian. Now let&amp;rsquo;s check the availability on all Debian versions, it&amp;rsquo;s currently only on oldstable and experimental versions :</description>

      <description>I was searching a way to minify my CSS. For those who don’t know what it is, it’s a method to win space for your CSS as it will remove all unneeded blank spaces and lines return. A lot of websites exists to minify your CSS, but if your website is not online and only running locally, you won’t be able to minimize it.
I found a little software written in Python, that makes it easy, called mincss (thanks to Peter Bengtsson for it).</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been running it since a few months on it (on my servers and as a desktop) and I congratulate Debian team for their work ! In the upcoming weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll try to start getting involved in some Debian&amp;rsquo;s packaging projects. My problem is : how many time do I have to give ?
One of my first taks, will be to integrate MySecureShell in the officials Debian repositories.</description>

Je vous en avait déjà parlé il y a quelques temps. Allez&amp;hellip;un petit refresh pour ceux qui ont oubliés : c&amp;rsquo;est un fork de MySQL, fait par l&amp;rsquo;auteur de MySQL.
MariaDB prends aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de plus en plus d’essor et nous propose depuis un petit moment maintenant sa solution cluster à base de Galera (qui fonctionne aussi sous MySQL).</description>

      <description>Je me suis récemment commandé une Soekris car la mienne commence a avoir des problèmes d&amp;rsquo;alimentation au niveau de la carte mère (s&amp;rsquo;allume 1 fois sur 10).
Depuis le temps que j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;ancienne et vu qu&amp;rsquo;elle tourne en permanence, je trouve que c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment du bon matos ! Du coup pour remplacer celle ci, je me suis prit la 6501-70 avec Atom 1,6Ghz, 2 Go de RAM et SSD Intel 30G.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques semaines, je discutais avec un collègue de NetBSD. Il me racontait ses bonnes expériences avec cet OS. Vu que ça faisait un moment que je voulais essayé, je me suis lancé et ai changé l&amp;rsquo;OS de ma Soekris de FreeBSD à NetBSD. De plus, iMil n&amp;rsquo;arrête pas d&amp;rsquo;en parler et ça m&amp;rsquo;a donc fortement chatouillé.
L&amp;rsquo;installeur est sympatoche, le coup du pkgin à la fin c&amp;rsquo;est top (bien qu&amp;rsquo;un peu de simplification pour les néophytes serait pas mal) et les VirtIO intégrés, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment bien joué.</description>

      <description>Voici une interface web plutôt bien fichue qui permet de vous gérer vos serveurs Bind. Son nom est NamedManager. Elle sait aussi bien gérer des trucs classique, que des choses un peu plus poussée (la gestion automatique des PTR, le renseignement automatique un subnet, le multi serveurs&amp;hellip;) et en plus elle est élégante !
Je vous ai fait une doc pour sa mise en place qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi simple qu&amp;rsquo;on pourrait l&amp;rsquo;imaginer.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, c&amp;rsquo;est une très bonne nouvelle qui vient de tomber ! SkySQL rachète MariaDB. Les boites frileuses de passer sous MariaDB, sous prétexte qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas de boites derrière, vont pouvoir être rassurer et y aller pour de la production. C&amp;rsquo;est donc une excellente nouvelle pour MariaDB dont certains moteurs passent en OpenSource comme tokudb par exemple.
Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;à terme, un bon paquet de distributions, tel que Mageia (cc Kharec), vont switcher sur MariaDB et abandonner définitivement MySQL.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai eu il y a quelques temps une petite formation par le mainteneur officiel de LemonLDAP::NG actuel (Clément Oudot). Superbe formation, surtout lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on voit ce que LdemonLDAP est capable d&amp;rsquo;apporter en terme de fonctionnalités par rapports à d&amp;rsquo;autres SSO. De plus son architecture et son mode de fonctionnement est très bien pensé.
Bref, un des hits aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui ! Seul petit b mol pour le moment, il n&amp;rsquo;est compatible qu&amp;rsquo;avec Apache. Si vous êtes un aficionados de Lighty ou Nginx, passez votre chemin.</description>

      <description>Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, à Linagora, je travaille dans une équipe de support dont je suis le leader technique. Seulement voilà, mes gars ne connaissent pas de solutions de reporting de machine. Du coup, lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on a un client chez qui on doit récupérer des données d&amp;rsquo;une machine de prod, il est bien pratique d&amp;rsquo;avoir toutes les données d&amp;rsquo;un coup et éviter les aller/retour avec celui ci.
Dans mon ancienne boite, j&amp;rsquo;utilisais pas mal le support RedHat et le sosreport est quelque chose que j&amp;rsquo;ai pas mal utilisé.</description>

Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas encore totalement fini ma configuration comme je le souhaite, mais c&amp;rsquo;est déjà pleinement utilisable pour le quotidien.
Vous pouvez récupérer ma configuration Awesome sur mon git. Dans le rc.lua, vous trouverez les packages à installer sur Debian Wheezy, ainsi que les instructions nécessaire à son installation. Une fois la configuration chargée, faites la touche Super (Windows) + F1 pour obtenir toute l&amp;rsquo;aide nécessaire au fonctionnement de ma configuration.</description>

Entre autre, j&amp;rsquo;ai découvert par un collègue, les polices Powerline. Et j&amp;rsquo;ai kiffé. Comme le montre le screeshot ci dessus, ça nous fait des espèces de flèches jolies. Si je ne dis pas de bêtises, l&amp;rsquo;origine de ceci est un module pour Vim et aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui on commence à voir apparaître plusieurs outils utilisant ces powerlines.

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment aidé un ancien collègue qui avait besoin d&amp;rsquo;une solution pour forcer des utilisateurs ayant déjà un shell LDAP à avoir un shell plus restreint de type lshell. La problématique est que si l&amp;rsquo;on change le shell au niveau LDAP, il faudra alors utiliser ce shell sur toutes les machines. Ce n&amp;rsquo;est donc tout simplement pas envisageable.
Par contre, il est possible de modifier les propriétés NSS lors du login :-).</description>

Pour ceux qui veulent voir à quoi ça ressemble&amp;hellip;ça se passe ici.

Et ce qui est bien, c&amp;rsquo;est de pouvoir faire du Qemu dans du KVM. Bon attention aux performances et aux bugs quand même, je vous rappelle que c&amp;rsquo;est du test et que ça s&amp;rsquo;appuie sur la version actuelle du repository.</description>

      <description>Il y a quelques années, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà fait un upgrade de mon Mac Mini qui me sert aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui de serveur.
Maintenant, je commence a avoir de nouveaux besoins, nécessitant de plus en plus de ressources. J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà quelques problèmes d&amp;rsquo;I/O, ce qui m&amp;rsquo;a pousser à prendre un SSD et un besoin de plus des 4 Gb de mémoire installés. En parcourant la documentation de mon Mac mini, la taille maximale annoncée est de 4Gb.</description>

      <description>Et voilà encore une migration de faite. Elle s&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien passée, alors que c&amp;rsquo;était mal partie. En effet, il a fallut que je change la configuration de mon Nginx pour que cette nouvelle mouture fonctionne. Ces informations n&amp;rsquo;étant pas marquées dans la documentation officielle, j&amp;rsquo;ai perdu un peu de temps en pensant que ma migration avait foirée.
En montant une autre plateforme from scratch, j&amp;rsquo;avais le même problème. Le soucis était alors rapidement identifiable.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment écrit un article sur le blog de Linagora, concernant ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu voir au FOSDEM. Voici mon article :
MediaWiki est un logiciel libre orienté serveur, disponible sous Licence publique générale GNU (GNU General Public License – GPL). Il est conçu pour fonctionner dans une ferme composée d’un bon nombre de serveurs appartenant à un site web qui peut avoir plusieurs millions de clics par jour. MediaWiki est un logiciel extrêmement puissant, adaptable à souhait et permettant une implémentation de wiki aux fonctionnalités riches.</description>

Dans le même esprit (mais plus orienté développement), on a l&amp;rsquo;ancien et vénérable Bugzilla qui fonctionne parfaitement et est utilisé encore aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui par de nombreuses sociétés ou pour des projets communautaires.
Je vous ai fait une petite documentation sur la mise en place de Bugzilla car j&amp;rsquo;ai du en installer une récemment. Si vous avez envie de jouer un peu avec, c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;occasion :-)</description>

      <description>KVM, quel merveilleux hyperviseur ! Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise depuis plusieurs années sur mes serveurs et je commence a l&amp;rsquo;utiliser sur ma workstation pour plusieurs raisons. Je vais comparer KVM a l&amp;rsquo;outil de virtualisation gratuit, a la mode : VirtualBox. Voici les raisons qui me poussent a passer a KVM :
 La licence : VirtualBox c&amp;rsquo;est bien, mais si je peux éviter toute dépendance avec Oracle, c&amp;rsquo;est mieux ! Je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas envie de connaître a fond une techno propriétaire qui peut d&amp;rsquo;un jour a l&amp;rsquo;autre basculer de gratuite à payante (faut pas oublier que c&amp;rsquo;est Oracle hein !</description>

      <description>Une fois n&amp;rsquo;est pas coutume, j&amp;rsquo;ai acheté un logiciel. Certains rigoleront parce que c&amp;rsquo;est simplement pour gérer des flux RSS. Mais lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on dépasse les 300 flux utilisés, il est important d&amp;rsquo;avoir un outil performant et fonctionnel.
Il y a quelques jours, Google annonçait la date de fermeture du service Google Reader. Je me suis mis a chercher une alternative self-hosted ! Et a part Tiny-Tiny RSS qui manque de quelques fonctions indispensable, Leed qui ne possède pas d&amp;rsquo;application pour smartphone, le choix commençait a se rétrécir.</description>

Concrètement qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est ? Simplement une suite de CSS/JavaScripts/Images pour habiller ton site et en plus responsiveness. Et a mettre en place, c&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante.

      <description>Les SSD coûtent de moins en moins cher et leurs performances sont incroyables comparées a celles des disques classiques.
Pourtant, si on ne fait pas un peu de tuning pour les optimiser, on perd des performances (moins linéaires) avec le temps et on réduit surtout leurs durée de vie.
Récemment j&amp;rsquo;ai passé tous mes ordinateurs perso sous SSD et par chance au boulot j&amp;rsquo;ai pu être équipé d&amp;rsquo;une bête de course avec SSD également.</description>

      <description>Titre provocateur ? Oui, c&amp;rsquo;est vrai ! En même temps, Vmware se repose un peu sur ses lauriers et OpenStack prend de l’ampleur. Il fallait bien en match pour les départager.
Je suis récemment tombé sur ce match intéressant entre Vmware et OpenStack.
Mon avis personnel sur ce match est qu&amp;rsquo;il est très difficile de vraiment les départager. Tout dépends du besoin et de l&amp;rsquo;évolution de celui ci. Néanmoins, cet article est très intéressant car il cite les fonctionnalités majeures de chacun et les compares.</description>

Il est possible de faire mieux, plus classe et surtout : tout OS confondus (à condition que son navigateur supporte HTML 5 sur), ça s&amp;rsquo;appelle Impress.js !
Comment ? Regardez une démo d&amp;rsquo;Impress.js http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/
C&amp;rsquo;est donc en Javascript, c&amp;rsquo;est beau, simple à utiliser (quand on code un peu). Et pour les moins codeurs d&amp;rsquo;entre nous, voici un autre lien qui devrait vous plaire, c&amp;rsquo;est une interface pour Impress.</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est lors d&amp;rsquo;une formation accélérée dans ma boîte que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu découvrir a quel point Git est puissant. Pourtant j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression de n&amp;rsquo;en avoir toujours vu qu&amp;rsquo;une infime partie.

 Le Principe de Peter, également appelé « syndrome de la promotion Focus » de Laurence J. Peter et Raymond Hull, est un principe relatif à l&amp;rsquo;organisation hiérarchique. Il est paru originalement sous le titre The Peter Principle (1969)1.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai commandé et reçu en moins d&amp;rsquo;une semaine un Raspberry Pi B (512Mb de RAM).
C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment un beau jouet et le rapport qualité prix est vraiment très bon !
Le petit point négatif que j&amp;rsquo;aurais a dire est l&amp;rsquo;absence de bouton power. Du fait que le courant soit délivré par USB, ce matériel fonctionne comme n&amp;rsquo;importe quel périphérique USB, c&amp;rsquo;est a dire allumé lorsqu&amp;rsquo;il est branché et éteint, débranché. Certains diront qu&amp;rsquo;il faut le laisser en permanence branché vu sa faible consommation (~3-3,5W), mais je ne suis pas de cet avis.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;en suis extrêmement satisfait ! Cependant, malgré la gestion du cache via Nginx, les performances ne sont pas aussi bonnes qu&amp;rsquo;attendues.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc testé Nginx avec Varnish, histoire de me refaire une opinion et effectivement Varnish fait vraiment la différence, non seulement côté temps de réponse, mais surtout côté CPU !</description>

Un des supers sujet était Bind 10 que j&amp;rsquo;attendais avec impatience. Il n&amp;rsquo;y a malheureusement eu d&amp;rsquo;informations sur les nouveautés aidant a la HA. Cependant il a été totalement réécrit pour supporter + de 100 cores alors qu&amp;rsquo;aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui au delà de 6, il y a des problèmes de performances. On a également (et étrangement) un serveur DHCP qui est intégré a Bind.</description>

      <description>Et me voilà parti grâce à Linagora au FOSDEM 2013 :-). C&amp;rsquo;est donc mon premier jour et premier FOSDEM.
Au menu une petite intro Ubuntu sur Juju et MASS mais piètre qualité du représentant de Canonical. Quelque chose a retenir cependant, il faut vraiment tester Ceph :
Heureusement qu&amp;rsquo;il y a eu une magnifique représentation MediaWiki avec du Jenkins, PhantomJS (incroyable) et d&amp;rsquo;autres produits dont Cucumber (qui est très impressionnant). Le mec de Wikipedia/MediaWiki avait vraiment l&amp;rsquo;air de bien connaître son sujet c&amp;rsquo;était top :</description>

      <description>Vous avez peut être entendu parler de cette police ? Elle permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir une aisance de lecture pour faire du développement. Pas toujours facile de distinguer les 0 des O, les I des l etc&amp;hellip; Avec cette police, c&amp;rsquo;est très simple.
Je vous invite donc à installer Dina, elle est gratuite.</description>

      <description>Si vous utilisez MediaWiki, vous n&amp;rsquo;avez pas forcément besoin de toutes les fonctionnalités. Certaines peuvent disparaître via de la configuration, d&amp;rsquo;autres via des Hook ou pire via de l&amp;rsquo;édition de code.
Bref, voici une solution pour supprimer l&amp;rsquo;onglet &amp;ldquo;Discussion&amp;rdquo; de toutes les pages. C&amp;rsquo;est un Hook pour Mediawiki disponible ici.</description>

Même si j&amp;rsquo;aime beaucoup ce que ces magazines proposent, tout ne m&amp;rsquo;intéresse pas et je dirais que c&amp;rsquo;est normal. Cependant ils font de temps en temps des hors série sur un sujet bien particulier qui permet de découvrir de nouveaux horizons.</description>

      <title>Jenkins : L’intégration continue</title>

      <description>Jenkins est un outil open source d&amp;rsquo;intégration continue, fork de l&amp;rsquo;outil Hudson après les différends entre son auteur, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, et Oracle. Écrit en Java, Jenkins fonctionne dans un conteneur de servlets tel qu’Apache Tomcat, ou en mode autonome avec son propre serveur Web embarqué.
Dans le cadre de l&amp;rsquo;amélioration de Limesurvey comme cité dans un précédent ticket, le couplage Selenium/Jenkins est très pratique. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais une documentation sur la mise en place de Jenkins.</description>

      <description>Dans le cadre d&amp;rsquo;amélioration des produits Open Source, je travaille avec un collègue en relation avec le créateur de LimeSurvey pour fournir une plateforme de test de non régression qui sera généreusement prêtée par Linagora.
Dans ce cadre, nous utilisons l&amp;rsquo;outil Selenium pour tester l&amp;rsquo;interface graphique car nous avons régulièrement observé des régressions sur ce produit. Selenium est donc très pratique et surtout d&amp;rsquo;une facilité déconcertante !
J&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même fait une documentation sur Selenium pour ceux que ça intéresse.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai cherché la même chose pour présenter des PDF car j&amp;rsquo;ai donné une formation LPI 101 et j&amp;rsquo;avais besoin d&amp;rsquo;être aussi à l&amp;rsquo;aise qu&amp;rsquo;avec les PPT. Voici ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai trouvé :</description>

      <description>Qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est bien Git ! Un peu complexe mais tellement puissant.
Bref comme vous le savez maintenant, la nouvelle version de l&amp;rsquo;extension DeleteHistory est sortie. Et la méthode d&amp;rsquo;installation a la mode de Mediawiki est d&amp;rsquo;utiliser directement git et non plus l&amp;rsquo;outil de téléchargement du site Mediawiki.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc voulu suivre le move et créer des repository dédiés a mes extensions Mediawiki tout en gardant l&amp;rsquo;historique de mon ancien repository.</description>

      <description>Cela faisait un moment que je n&amp;rsquo;avais pas développer pour Mediawiki.
Voici la version 0.5 de DeleteHistory avec quelques petites nouveautés lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on demande une optimisation des tables MySQL :
 L&amp;rsquo;ajout du moteur utilisé pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la collation utilisée pour chacune des tables. L&amp;rsquo;ajout de la traduction en Allemand  Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas grand chose, mais ça aide grandement a voir pourquoi certaines tables ne sont pas optimisées.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment donné cours pour la LPI 101 comme vous le savez. J&amp;rsquo;ai rédigé du coup quelques questions/réponses pour vous aider a réviser cette certification en m&amp;rsquo;appuyant sur le wiki LPI.
J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera ceux qui souhaitent passer la certif. Évidement ces questions ne sont qu&amp;rsquo;une mince partie de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il faut savoir pour cette certif, mais elles permettent toutefois de valider votre niveau et vous entraîner a passer la 101.</description>

      <description>C&amp;rsquo;est en migrant vers la dernière version de Debian (Wheezy) que je me suis rendu compte que php5-suhoshin avait disparu. Après quelques apt-cache et recherche sur le site de Debian, il n&amp;rsquo;y a effectivement plus de Suhoshin !
Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que les gars de chez Debian estiment que Suhoshin devrait être intégré mainstream dans le code de PHP et que ça ne devrait pas être aux distribution de les packager.</description>

      <description>Pour migrer une VM avec des disques de type qcow2, c&amp;rsquo;est très simple, il suffit de les copier les fichiers tel quel. Mais lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on utilise du LVM, la migration peut sembler forcément un peu plus complexe, bien qu&amp;rsquo;elle ne le soit pas vraiment.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite section sur mon article KVM qui parle de migration de VM sous LVM.</description>

      <description>Fini le duo Apache/Varnish performant mais gourmand en ressources. Pour de gros sites, c&amp;rsquo;est certains que ce couple est très utile, mais pour mon blog, mon wiki et mes autre babioles, pas forcément !
Alors voilà, je suis passé à Nginx et après plusieurs jours dessus, je suis globalement satisfait. Petit bémol pour le stockage des éléments statiques qui n&amp;rsquo;est visiblement pas faisable sans passer par du proxy_pass. J&amp;rsquo;ai pu observer une gestion du cache globale moins efficace avec Nginx qu&amp;rsquo;avec Varnish.</description>

      <description>Hello a tous,
Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas encore, configurer Gmail comme si c&amp;rsquo;était un serveur exchange sur leurs iPhone va bientôt ne plus fonctionner. Le service ferme ses portes pour les comptes gratuits fin janvier.
Google fait ça pour 2 raisons :
 La licence a payer a Microsoft pour utiliser ActiveSync. Parce que Microsoft n&amp;rsquo;a toujours pas ouvert les standards libre sur ces terminaux.  Pour se passer d&amp;rsquo;Exchange sur son iPhone et le configurer pour avoir l&amp;rsquo;équivalence des services, voici comment faire&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Je ne sais pas si vous avez déjà entendu parler de gérer une infrastructure comme un développeur le ferait avec du code. A première vue cela semble étrange, mais après réflexion vous allez voir que c’est très astucieux.
Déjà pour commencer&amp;hellip;qui utilise cette méthode ?
 OpenStack : https://review.openstack.org MediaWiki : https://lwn.net/Articles/480002/  Plutôt des gens qui ont de grosses infrastructures donc. Mais concrètement en quoi ça consiste ? Beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;articles existent en anglais sur le net et abordent le sujet, mais je n&amp;rsquo;en ai pas vraiment trouvé qui parlaient de comment mettre en place ce genre de méthodes et avec quels outils.</description>

      <description>Newznab est un indexeur de newznab. Il sert par exemple à être utilisé avec SABnzbd ou encore Sick-Beard. Il est ensuite très pratique de pouvoir faire des recherche par celui ci pour connaître par exemple les dernières distributions Linux sur les newsgroup ;-).

      <description>PuppetDB permet de récupérer les données collectées par Puppet comme les facts et d’utiliser entre autres les ressources exportées. Ces données pourront ensuite être utilisées par d’autres programmes, comme le dashboard, ou vos propres outils grâce à une API.
Il est donc utile de mettre en place ce genre de solution quand on commence à avoir un parc d&amp;rsquo;une centaine de machines ou une configuration assez conséquente.
Voici la doc de PuppetDB pour en mettre un rapidement en place.</description>

Mis à part les gains de perfs qui ne changent rien a la configuration, j&amp;rsquo;ai rajouté :
 Passenger : qui est l&amp;rsquo;officiel remplaçant du couple Mongrel/Nginx L&amp;rsquo;installation : celle ci se fait très simplement en installant un package deb ou rpm qui va installer le repository ainsi que la clé GPG associée La syntaxe : bien qu&amp;rsquo;elle change un peu, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas eu à retoucher mes modules du fait que je l&amp;rsquo;avais créer avec Gepetto et que ce plugin éclipse m&amp;rsquo;avait aider à écrire correctement tout mon code Puppet Gestion des certificat : puppetca a été mergé dans la commande puppet (comme beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;autres) et s&amp;rsquo;appelle avec les mêmes arguments qu&amp;rsquo;avant via &amp;lsquo;puppet cert&amp;rsquo; Puppetd : celui ci a aussi merger dans puppet et s&amp;rsquo;appelle maintenant via &amp;lsquo;puppet server&amp;rsquo; ou &amp;lsquo;puppet&amp;rsquo; suivant les cas d&amp;rsquo;usage.</description>

root /usr/share/nginx/www;  J&amp;rsquo;ai donc regardé le README.Debian qui me renvoie sur l&amp;rsquo;explication : http://lintian.debian.org/tags/dir-or-file-in-var-www.html
Debian a tout simplement remis les choses propres en suivant la FHS.</description>

      <title>Mediawiki 1.20 et les URL courtes</title>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment passé mon Mediawiki en 1.20. J&amp;rsquo;ai eu quelques petits soucis avec l&amp;rsquo;URL rewriting et les short URL. En effet, dans cette nouvelle version, ils ont supprimé le $wgUsePathInfo qui a du coup complètement cassé mes redirections.
J&amp;rsquo;ai finalement réussi à retrouver mon URL short mais d&amp;rsquo;une autre manière que je vous partage ici.
Bonne lecture</description>

      <description>Toujours dans mes articles sur Tomcat, en voici un qui touche au clustering. Que l&amp;rsquo;on soit bien d&amp;rsquo;accord, le clustering Tomcat, c&amp;rsquo;est pas du failover avec un cluster applicatif externe. C&amp;rsquo;est une méthode interne à Tomcat permettant de synchroniser des sessions (et pas que).
Je vous ai fais une petite documentation pour une mise en place éclair de ce genre de solution.</description>

      <description>Si certains d&amp;rsquo;entre vous n&amp;rsquo;utilisent pas encore le module Jetpack pour WordPress, je les invite très rapidement le faire. C&amp;rsquo;est un module qui comprends plusieurs sous-modules, tous très facilement activable, d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité déconcertante et pour certains très performants.
Dans l&amp;rsquo;une des dernières updates de Jetpack, il y a l&amp;rsquo;infinite scrolling que je souhaitais activer. Malheureusement, pour le thème que j&amp;rsquo;utilise (Yoko)&amp;hellip;impossible de l&amp;rsquo;activer, il n&amp;rsquo;est pas supporté :-(. Une petite recherche sur le forum de wordpress m&amp;rsquo;a permit de voir que je n&amp;rsquo;étais pas le seul sur cette demande.</description>

Synergy vous permet de partager facilement votre souris et votre clavier entre plusieurs ordinateurs. Il est libre et Open Source. Il suffit de déplacer la souris d&amp;rsquo;un ordinateur à l&amp;rsquo;autre en passant par leurs bords, comme pour passer d&amp;rsquo;un écran à l&amp;rsquo;autre en multi-écran. Vous pouvez même partager les presse-papiers (copier-coller).</description>

Et donc pour ajouter une Application dans la liste des Applications sous Gnome Shell, il faut se le faire à la main malheureusement.</description>

Il existe pour cela 2 manières :

Puis le mode user friendly avec les associations sur les fichiers, les logiciels preinstallés à la ubuntu sont quand même vachement pratique, même s&amp;rsquo;il y en a un peu trop à mon goût ou pas les toujours ceux que je souhaiterais par défaut.</description>

Il permet de se connecter à plusieurs type de bases de données (MySQL, DB2, Oracle&amp;hellip;) et est multi plateformes !!! Il n&amp;rsquo;est certes pas très beau, mais très fonctionnel !</description>

J&amp;rsquo;avais déjà observé ceci sur les Red Hat 6.3 et viens de le constater également sur une Debian 6.

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2012/10/24/introduction-au-nosql/</guid>
      <description>NoSQL signifie “Not Only SQL”, littéralement “pas seulement SQL”. Ce terme désigne l’ensemble des bases de données qui s’opposent à la notion relationnelle des SGBDR. La définition, “pas seulement SQL”, apporte un début de réponse à la question “Est ce que le NoSQL va tuer les bases relationnelles?”. En effet, NoSQL ne vient pas remplacer les BD relationnelles mais proposer une alternative ou compléter les fonctionnalités des SGBDR pour donner des solutions plus intéressantes dans certains contextes.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai fais quelques recherches également sur le net pour voir des benchs entre varnish et le cache nginx. Il apparait qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a qu&amp;rsquo;environ 5% de performances de différence en faveur de Varnish, mais qu&amp;rsquo;il y a une plus grosse utilisation du CPU pour ce dernier.</description>

Cela permet d&amp;rsquo;arriver soit en courant, soit serein :-)
C&amp;rsquo;est un script qui va parser l&amp;rsquo;interface web graphique de Nagios, récupérer le minimum d&amp;rsquo;informations pour un bon affichage sur smartphone et envoyer un mail.</description>

      <title>Utiliser l’API de Sabnzbd</title>

      <description>Je trouve qu&amp;rsquo;il ne manque pas grand chose à Sabnzbd pour qu&amp;rsquo;il soit parfait. Cependant certaines options manquent et heureusement l&amp;rsquo;API est là pour compenser. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris un script en python permettant de jouer avec l&amp;rsquo;API que délivre Sabnzbd. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai créer dans l&amp;rsquo;idée qu&amp;rsquo;il soit facile de rajouter une fonctionnalité via l&amp;rsquo;API. Ce script permet :
 De voir les éléments que fournit l&amp;rsquo;API XML De supprimer un certain nombre d&amp;rsquo;éléments dans l&amp;rsquo;historique  J&amp;rsquo;espère que ça aidera certains à se plonger dedans, améliorer mon script ou bien utiliser les fonctions déjà existantes.</description>

      <description>Un ami m&amp;rsquo;a récemment prêté sa GoPro pour faire joujou. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai utilisée un peu violemment (c&amp;rsquo;est à dire que la vitesse avec les accoups violent c&amp;rsquo;est pas son truc à première vue) et la video faite ne s&amp;rsquo;est pas terminée correctement (illisible via VLC pour vous donner le niveau).
Après quelques recherches sur le net, j&amp;rsquo;ai fini par tomber sur des posts intéressant pour réparer des videos en MP4. La solution que j&amp;rsquo;ai trouvée fonctionne mais sans le son, qui à l&amp;rsquo;air plus compliqué à récupérer que la vidéo.</description>

Je me suis dis : &amp;ldquo;Bon un Nas, ça serait pas mal quand même, mais ça fait cher pour l&amp;rsquo;utilité que je souhaites !&amp;rdquo;. Surtout que je ne souhaites pas des fonctionnalités de fou, je veux un truc en du RAID 1, qui lit tout les formats video et qui ne consomme pas beaucoup lorsque je n&amp;rsquo;utilise pas !</description>

Si vos connaissances en programmation sont en plus limitées, je vous conseil fortement ce livre sur Perl. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai lu il y a des années et c&amp;rsquo;est aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui grâce à lui que j&amp;rsquo;ai de bonnes bases.</description>

Vous connaissez certainement Page Speed, l&amp;rsquo;extension pour Firefox qui vous dit ce qui pourrait être améliorer pour optimiser les temps de chargements de votre site. Certains points sont délicats à mettre en place, alors Google a fait un module pour Apache (mod_pagespeed) qui permet de couvrir une partie de ces optimisations. De base, beaucoup de choses sont activées et on voit la différences sur les sites non optimisés.</description>

      <description>TinyProxy est un proxy, tout comme Squid, mais qui se veut être léger. Je l&amp;rsquo;utilise au travail sur ma machine pour mettre toutes mes applications dessus. L&amp;rsquo;avantage est d&amp;rsquo;avoir la configuration du proxy pour wget, apt, etc&amp;hellip; qui pointe en localhost. Ainsi dans la configuration de TinyProxy, il n&amp;rsquo;y a plus qu&amp;rsquo;à configurer le serveur Proxy sur lequel on veut taper pour que toute mes applications soient redirigées dessus sans avoir à les toucher au moindre changement :-)</description>

Voyez ce bouquin comme un retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience avec les best practices à adopter pour faire une bonne conf Puppet.
Pour vous donner un exemple, ce sera aussi mon retour d&amp;rsquo;expérience, j&amp;rsquo;ai utilisé Puppet pendant 2 ans et demie avec les fonctionnalités classiques et légèrement poussées.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai tenté d&amp;rsquo;expliquer chaque module avec les points les plus intéressants, les choses les plus pertinentes pour la compréhension et la découverte de certaines fonctionnalités.
C&amp;rsquo;est avec beaucoup de recul et plusieurs années d&amp;rsquo;expériences dans Puppet que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu arriver à avoir une certaine vision de ce qu&amp;rsquo;il est possible de faire et ai donc passé en revue tous mes modules.</description>

      <description>Toujours dans la lignée de l&amp;rsquo;article sur Puppet (voir articles précédents), je vous propose cette fois ci un deuxième article, qui contient des astuces et des cas d&amp;rsquo;utilisation du langage. Que ce soit pour les manifests, les templates, facter, parser etc&amp;hellip;
Pour ceux qui se sont arrêter aux manifests et ont trouvé des limitations ou tout simplement ne se sont pas encore posée la question de savoir ce que l&amp;rsquo;on pouvait bien faire de plus que les ressources de base, je vous conseil d&amp;rsquo;aller voir, vous risquez d&amp;rsquo;être surpris par la puissance de Puppet :-)</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour la documentation sur Puppet sur la partie installation et la configuration du serveur. Je prépare quelques autres mises à jour de cet article qui vous aideront j&amp;rsquo;espère, à mettre en place ce type de solution qui devient très très vite indispensable :-)
Voici la mise à jour de l&amp;rsquo;installation et la configuration du puppet master.</description>

      <description>Cela fait un moment que j&amp;rsquo;avais entendu parler du module SPDY (prononcez Speedy), module d&amp;rsquo;Apache développé par Google qui va booster votre site web SSL. Plus qu&amp;rsquo;un grand discourt, voici une video de 6 secondes qui en dit long :
  Pour la mise en place, c&amp;rsquo;est d&amp;rsquo;une simplicité enfantine ! Comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude, j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation pour la mise en place de SPDY</description>

      <description>Pourquoi tant de haine ? Sérieusement, je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi Solaris et maintenant Red Hat nous poussent à ce que les interfaces réseaux possèdent le nom court du chipset des cartes. C&amp;rsquo;est tellement chiant lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaite gérer un parc informatique de manière automatisée.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc fais un petit article pour dire comment revenir à nos bonnes vieilles interfaces en ethX. C&amp;rsquo;est pas ici.</description>

      <description>Bon&amp;hellip;on est encore loin du compte par rapport au ZFS hein ! Mais par rapport à l&amp;rsquo;extX, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment un pas de géant. Etant donné que la première version stable du BTRFS est sortie, je me suis dis qu&amp;rsquo;il était temps de faire un article là dessus.
Si vous avez envie de voir ce qu&amp;rsquo;est un filesystem avancé, je vous conseil fortement de commencer à vous y mettre car c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;avenir sous Linux.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;hallucine ! Mozilla arrête le développement de Thunderbird ! C&amp;rsquo;est tout simplement incroyable. J&amp;rsquo;adore ce client et ses plugins en font sa force !
Ils ont visiblement décidé d&amp;rsquo;arrêter car la plus part des gens utilisent le web mail.
Je suis vraiment déçu.
J&amp;rsquo;espère sincèrement qu&amp;rsquo;un fork va voir le jour et que le produit va continuer à vivre.
D&amp;rsquo;après les dernières news que l&amp;rsquo;on peut voir sur le net, il semblerait que Mozilla va se concentrer d&amp;rsquo;avantage sur la stabilité du produit que ses évolutions.</description>

Nous en profitons donc pour utiliser KVM et avons recours à des fonctionnalités un peu plus avancées que start and stop. Par exemple :
 Utilisation des VMs en NAT Une configuration iptables pour passer le NAT Ajouter des disques à chaud Dédier des CPU à une VM  J&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis à jour la documentation sur KVM avec les fonctionnalités citées ci dessus.</description>

Si vous avez déjà quelques notions en Python, ça devrait aller. C&amp;rsquo;est plus un aide mémoire qu&amp;rsquo;un Tutoriel complet pour apprendre Python. Je pense qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a suffisament sur le net pour que je tombe dans ce genre de travers.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment passé ma Soekris sur FreeBSD (oui marre de PFSense, je sais je change vite d&amp;rsquo;avis, mais là ça sent bon), et je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas encore tous les automatismes, alors j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite documentation sur les fondamentaux réseaux de FreeBSD.

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai récemment fait un article sur la mise en place d&amp;rsquo;un serveur PowerDNS maitre. En voici un sur le cache. C&amp;rsquo;est très rapide à mettre en place :-)

      <title>PowerAdmin : une interface web de gestion de PowerDNS</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2012/05/27/poweradmin-une-interface-web-de-gestion-de-powerdns/</guid>
      <description>PowerAdmin est une interface d&amp;rsquo;administration pour PowerDNS. Elle est faite en PHP et permet de gérer bien plus que la majorité des fonctionnalités de base de PowerDNS.
Elle est très utile si vous avez un backend MySQL qui n&amp;rsquo;est pas très pratique pour ajouter des enregistrements/zones ou toucher à la configuration de PowerDNS.
Pour la mise en place de cette interface, c&amp;rsquo;est par ici.</description>

      <title>PowerDNS : un concurrent de Bind</title>

      <guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2012/05/25/powerdns-un-concurrent-de-bind/</guid>
      <description>PowerDNS est (comme son nom l&amp;rsquo;indique) un serveur DNS. C&amp;rsquo;est un concurrent direct à Bind. Il se veut moins gourmand en RAM et offre une utilisation de configuration plus souple que Bind.
PowerDNS est découpé en plusieurs rôles :

      <description>Derrière ce titre pompeux se cache en fait la méthode pour activer le port série au démarrage d&amp;rsquo;une machine. Cette solution s&amp;rsquo;avère vite pratique lorsque l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites accéder à certaines machines qui ne répondent plus, ou bien via des solutions de virtualisation.
C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi je vous ai concocté :
 Une petite doc sur le port série sous Linux Une petite doc sur le port série sous FreeBSD Une mise à jour de la doc de KVM pour pouvoir y accéder cash (oui comme tabata)  &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>MediaWiki 1.19 est sorti il y a peu de temps et comme à chaque upgrade, c&amp;rsquo;est un bonheur, sauf lorsque vous faites des modifications de skins ou de code. Pour ma part, j&amp;rsquo;aime bien modifier les skins pour y insérer des Google Ads. Mais voilà, comme je viens de l&amp;rsquo;expliquer, a chaque update j&amp;rsquo;ai tout qui est déglingué.
Donc pour palier à ce problème, il existe une petite extension fort sympathique, qui permet d&amp;rsquo;insérer du code à certains endroits de vos skins MediaWiki.</description>

      <description>Quant on commence à vouloir faire beaucoup de réseaux au niveau de KVM, la configuration devient vite casse tête. C&amp;rsquo;est pourquoi je vais en aider certains qui comme moi pensaient qu&amp;rsquo;une configuration VLAN standard suffirait pour faire fonctionner du VLAN bridgé sur KVM.

Alors ceci est fait pour toi !!! J&amp;rsquo;ai concocté un petit script (un peu sale oui je l&amp;rsquo;avoue, mais il a le mérite de bien fonctionner) que j&amp;rsquo;ai pomper sur une discussion Red Hat permettant donc de jouer avec les snapshot pour fsckiser (oui le verbe) à la volée tous les LV de type ext3 et 4 sur une machine !</description>

      <description>Jojo, mon expert MySQL (Joffrey de SkySQL pour ne pas le citer) me bassine depuis un moment à abandonner MySQL pour passer sur MariaDB.
Après quelques benchs qu&amp;rsquo;il a effectué, j&amp;rsquo;ai été bluffé et quant il m&amp;rsquo;a dit qu&amp;rsquo;en 5 min ça s&amp;rsquo;installait&amp;hellip;je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas perdu de temps. Donc le blog et le wiki tournent maintenant sur MariaDB :-)
Je vous conseil fortement de passer dessus, car au final, vous ne serrez pas perdu, vu que ce sont les mêmes commandes que MySQL (normal c&amp;rsquo;est un fork) et vous aurez de biens meilleures performances.</description>

      <description>Pour faire suite à l&amp;rsquo;article précédent, voici une interface évoluée pour Nagios (et Shinken) qui permet de se connecter à plusieurs Nagios en même temps et d&amp;rsquo;afficher des informations plus pertinentes par rapport à l&amp;rsquo;interface standard de Nagios.
J&amp;rsquo;ai également fait de la modification de code pour obtenir une interface minimale afin d&amp;rsquo;être optimisée pour des écrans dédiés au monitoring.
Suivez le guide :-)

Je n&amp;rsquo;aborde pas dans ce tuto toutes les facettes de ce soft tellement il y a de possibilités, je préfère laisser celà à la documentation officielle, mais plutôt un moyen de déployer rapidement cet outil et quelques exemples de prise en main rapide.</description>

Le petit hic par rapport à URD que j&amp;rsquo;utilise aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui est le manque du multi utilisateur. A part ça, c&amp;rsquo;est vraiment top et les applications tierces apportent à cet outil un super potentiel.

      <description>Si toi aussi tu possède une télécommande universelle (Logitech Harmony One pour ma part), que tu veux pouvoir gérer ta Freebox Player comme un périphérique normal (par Infra Rouge) et que tu te demande pourquoi il n&amp;rsquo;existe toujours pas de télécommande abordable qui fasse la techno sans fil qui t&amp;rsquo;embête également avec la Playstation, sache qu&amp;rsquo;il existe un moyen de contourner ceci.
Déjà, il faut savoir que même si t&amp;rsquo;es péter de tune, t&amp;rsquo;as beau t&amp;rsquo;acheter la Logitech la plus cher, elle ne fonctionnera pas avec la Playstation 3 ou bien la Freebox, pourquoi ?</description>

Évidemment, pourquoi les baies de disques FC feraient ça et pas nous ? Allez hop, tous les chemins mènent à Rome non ? Alors c&amp;rsquo;est parti pour une doc sur le multipathing.</description>

Et bien si et on peut en faire des choses dans ce /dev ! Je vous ai donc concocté une petite documentation sur ce merveilleux udev qui vous permettra de lancer des scripts au branchement d&amp;rsquo;un périphérique, de modifier le nom d&amp;rsquo;un device qui apparait dans /dev, de renomer /dev en /mes_periph_de_batard et moulte modifications de la muerta !</description>

      <description>Si vous avez des problèmes de temps d’accès et de débit sur votre espace disque temporaire pour MySQL, alors cet article est fait pour vous.
La solution consiste donc à utiliser le filesystem tmpfs et rediriger ses fichiers temporaires dessus.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc créer et mis à jour mes documentations. Vous aurez donc besoin de :

Quelles que soient les commandes que vous utilisez vous aurez ou non la possibilité de configurer l’utilisation d’un proxy en modifiant un fichier de configuration, une variable de d’environnement etc…
L&amp;rsquo;intérêt de proxychains est que la configuration ne se fait qu&amp;rsquo;une seule fois, dans son propre fichier de configuration.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;aimerais bien dire : &amp;ldquo;En route vers RHCA maintenant !&amp;rdquo;, mais je dois avouer que la route va être longue, cher et parsemée d’embuches. Il va me falloir 5 autres certifs pour atteindre ce titre. Il y en a 2 que je pense avoir sans trop de difficultés (Cluter + Statellite) tandis que la RH442 (celle dont j&amp;rsquo;ai eu la formation cette semaine) me semble bien complexe.</description>

Comme à mon habitude je ferais donc quelques petits articles sur certaines choses qui m&amp;rsquo;ont paru très intéressantes. Quoi qu&amp;rsquo;il en soit, je vous recommande fortement cette formation techniquement pointue.</description>

Et devoir refaire ma Ubuntu tous les 6 mois (car je veux upgrader) car la mise à jour c&amp;rsquo;est pas tip top, et bah yen a marre et je dis stop.
Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, un collègue me dit : &amp;ldquo;Mais pourquoi t’utilise pas Debian en unstable ?&amp;rdquo;. La réponse me semblait évidente, mais j&amp;rsquo;ai demandé pourquoi afin d&amp;rsquo;avoir une autre opinion que la mienne.</description>

Un hommage lui est rendu sur le site de sa société avec un lien vers un livre d&amp;rsquo;or et quelques explications sur son historique sont dispo sur clubic.
Même si je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas très bien connu Paolo, il m&amp;rsquo;a marqué. Je l&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré pour la première fois il y a plus de 5 ans, lorsque j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une formation chez Sysdream.</description>

Thierry Dijoux
 Bonjour,
j&amp;rsquo;ai beaucoup apprécier votre note concernant l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur Debian. Ca marche très bien, et je me demandais si vous aviez assez de recul vis à vis des tests que vous avez fait pour vous demander si l&amp;rsquo;installation de ZFS sur une debian en production était envisageable ou pas ?</description>

      <description>C&amp;rsquo;est un truc con, mais par défaut, Squid donne un peu trop d&amp;rsquo;informations lorsque quelqu&amp;rsquo;un le traverse pour accéder à un site.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc modifier la documentation sur Squid pour y ajouter ces 3 petites lignes : # Be more anonymous # That’s three pieces of information you may not want to give away: # - The host name of your proxy server # - The version of Squid it’s running # - The IP address of the system that’s making the request via the proxy forwarded_for off visible_hostname proxy.</description>

      <description>Cette semaine, j’ai eu des GROOOOOOOOSSES merdes avec une baie de disques. Une fois réparée, mon quorum cluster était injoignable, bien que pourtant présent en tant que LUN sur la baie de disques.
Donc quant mes noeuds du serveur se sont mis à booter, l&amp;rsquo;absence de quorum empêchait le cluster de monter et je n&amp;rsquo;avais donc pas la main sur mes machines.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc un cluster de 6 noeuds qui était en amnésie (youpi).</description>

      <description>C’est un géant de l’informatique qui vient de nous quitter. Dennis Ritchie, père du langage C et contributeur majeur du système d’exploitation Unix, est mort. Sa contribution à l’informatique moderne a été considérable. Le langage C est un des langages de programmation les plus utilisés dans le monde et se trouve au cœur d’une pléthore de programmes. Comme Linux ou Windows.</description>

      <description>Voici une fonctionnalité d’Autofs qui peut s’avérer très pratique ! Le fait de pouvoir monter chaque home directory de chaque utilisateur à la volée.
Je vous invite à regarder la mise à jour de ma documentation sur Autofs si cela vous intéresse.</description>

      <description>Durant ma formation RHCE de la semaine dernière, j’ai revu les LVM, ce qui m’a donné envie de repasser un peu de temps sur mes documentations vieillissantes.
Voici donc 2 documentations qui satisferons les personnes de 7 à 77 ans :
LVM : Utilisation des LVM
Sauvegardes et restaurations LVM via des Snapshots</description>

      <description>Cela fait longtemps que je crypte mes données avec ENCFS et j’en suis très satisfait, même si les performances ne sont pas au rendez vous (fuse). Il existe Luks (celui qui a dit skywalker sort) qui est intégré au noyau et qui est bien plus performant. Je pense qu’il est tout aussi fiable (pas testé sur du long terme, mais natif à Red Hat).
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc concocté comme à mon habitude une petite documentation sur Luks.</description>

      <description>Ça y est, après une petite semaine de formation me voilà RHCSA :-). J&amp;rsquo;ai fais 100% de bonnes réponses.
Dans la foulée j&amp;rsquo;ai passé le RHCE, mais la malheureusement c&amp;rsquo;est pas passé :-(. Je n&amp;rsquo;ai fais que 208 points sur 300 et il faut 210 point pour l&amp;rsquo;avoir. C&amp;rsquo;est rageant, surtout qu&amp;rsquo;on ne sait pas la ou on a merder, il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas de corrigé d&amp;rsquo;examen.
Je vais donc tenter de le repasser très prochainement.</description>

      <description>Voilà des années que j&amp;rsquo;utilise Google Reader avec joie. Mais de plus en plus je lis sur mes flux RSS des personnes qui pleurent d&amp;rsquo;avoir leurs données perdues par Google. Même en mode enterprise, il n&amp;rsquo;est aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui pas possible de sauvegarder simplement et de manière automatisées ses données.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc choisis de ne pas laisser mes données à Google et de m&amp;rsquo;en occuper. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc choisis Tiny Tiny RSS qui se veut être une très bonne alternative à Google Reader.</description>

      <description>Back to iPhone ! Je n’en pouvait plus d’Android ! C’est pourtant bien, mais trop loin du confort de l’iOS !
Alors oui, je vais peut être me faire jeter des tomates, oui, je vais me faire siffler ! Mais c&amp;rsquo;est comme ça ! Le côté gris de la force m&amp;rsquo;attire (noir étant Microsoft).
Android 3 (la version tablette) est tellement plus sexy que la version téléphone. Je me demande ce que Google fait ?</description>

 J&amp;rsquo;ai dû chopper une bêta XCode et l&amp;rsquo;installer Ce Xcode m&amp;rsquo;a été nécessaire pour installer MacPort. Qui lui n&amp;rsquo;était pas encore packagé Lion, j&amp;rsquo;ai donc du recompiler les sources depuis le SVN J&amp;rsquo;ai pu mettre à jour tous mes ports dont Encfs et Macfuse  Seulement voilà, même en mettant tout ce petit monde à jour, impossible de monter mon dossier crypté !</description>

      <description>Je maintiens tout ce que j’ai pu dire sur mes anciens post. Je me rends de plus en plus compte qu’Android c’est top rooté. Quid d’un iOS jailbreaké ?
Je pense au finale que ce doit etre kifkif. Je rappelle encore une fois que les grosses différences entre les 2 sont l&amp;rsquo;ergonomie et les fonctionnalités.
Il ne se passe pas un jour ou je regrette d&amp;rsquo;avoir laissé mon iphone et il ne se passe pas un jour ou je regrette d&amp;rsquo;avoir mon Android.</description>

      <description>Encore une fois, c&amp;rsquo;est une réussite d&amp;rsquo;Apple ! Ce Lion est plutôt bien fait, avec les améliorations à la iOS comme la synchronisation sur un compte Exchange (iCal, Mail et Contacts). Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une révélation non plus, mais on voit à peut prêt ou Apple veut en venir et j&amp;rsquo;espère que ce ne sera pas une régression pour les utilisateurs avertis dans les prochaines mises à jour de l&amp;rsquo;OS.</description>

 Mon blog : Le CSS3 ne s&amp;rsquo;affiche pas correctement WordPress : Créez un article en mode visuel, mettez un lien sur un bout de texte, et tapez sur la touche Entrée pour passer à la ligne&amp;hellip;ça ne fonctionne pas visuellement et pourtant en mode HTML on visualise bien les sauts de ligne L&amp;rsquo;importation depuis Firefox des bookmarks, il a fallu passez par des exports et imports manuel pour éviter le crash de Chrome Firebug moins complet sur Chrome que sur Firefox   Bon, ça commence à faire beaucoup, je n&#39;ai pas envie de perdre trop de temps donc on va garder encore une fois Firefox qui est au dessus de Chrome en terme de stabilité.</description>

Je n’ai pas encore eu le temps de mettre à jour la doc de mon wiki par rapport à mes acquis, mais j’espère pouvoir le faire très prochainement.
Bref, j&amp;rsquo;en ai profité pour faire un truc qui sous OpenVZ est super relou : les User Beancounters.</description>

Pour rentrer dans le vif du sujet, ceux qui attendent la réponse à : Est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;iPhone ou l&amp;rsquo;Android qui est le mieux ?
La réponse est simple : Il n&amp;rsquo;y en a pas un mieux que l&amp;rsquo;autre, tout dépends de l&amp;rsquo;utilisation que l&amp;rsquo;on souhaites faire de son téléphone</description>

      <description>Parce qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a marre de cette recherche minable dans MediaWiki, que j&amp;rsquo;ai bougé mes petites fesses et créer une extension pour ajouter à la &amp;ldquo;sidebar&amp;rdquo; : une recherche Google.
Il vous faudra bien entendu être inscrit au Google CSE ou encore Adsense pour pouvoir profiter de la recherche personnalisée. L&amp;rsquo;extension est bien entendue accessible sur Mediawiki ou mon git :

      <description>Et bah voilà, ça fait un moment que ça me trottait dans la tête de mettre en place un Puppet Dashboard, même si pour certaines personnes ça ne sert pas à grand chose. Ca permet au moins d&amp;rsquo;avoir une idée de comment se passe les synchronisations pour les fonctionnalités les plus basiques.
Une autre interface que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé existe, appelée The Forman.
Je testerais peut être plus tard cette interface, mais pour l&amp;rsquo;heure, voici la documentation pour Puppet Dashboard.</description>

J’ai donc testé Unison qui m’avait pas trop fait kiffé il y a quelques années du fait que si on veut une synchronisation parfaite, ce n’est pas possible.
Bref, aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui je pense que c&amp;rsquo;est un bon compromis pour ce que je souhaites faire donc voici une petite documentation comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude pour l&amp;rsquo;utilisation standard.</description>

      <description>En février dernier, un groupe de députés européens baptisé LEWP (Law Enforcement Working Party) a commencé à travailler en secret sur un projet de loi dont l’objectif est de mettre en place un grand firewall européen. Soutenus par les lobbies américains, ce projet de loi aura pour but d’exclure d’Europe certains sites internet considérés comme illégaux. Tous les FAI devront alors se plier à cette loi et appliquer ce filtrage Européen.</description>

      <description>Collectd c’est le bien. Mais les interfaces web manquent cruellement de maturité comparé à Munin. Un petit pointe le bout de son nez de plus en plus et se démarque des autres (à mon goût), c’est Visage.
Il manque encore quelques fonctionnalités, mais celles pour comparer ou visualiser un host fonctionnent à merveille. Comme à mon habitude, voici une documentation.</description>

      <description>Pour jouer un peu, j’ai installé un outil présenté dans le linux mag de ce mois ci qui permet d’avoir un terminal dans une interface web. Au début je ne voyais pas trop trop l’intérêt, puis après quelques réflexions, je me suis dis que ça pouvait pas être mal dans les endroits qui sont bien bloqués.
Alors voilà j&amp;rsquo;ai fais une petite doc comme d&amp;rsquo;habitude.</description>

Mais pourquoi j&amp;rsquo;ai fais ça ? Je souhaites que mon blog prenne plus d’essor, d’interaction avec les lecteurs. Si vous jetez un œil à mon Piwik, vous verrez qu&amp;rsquo;il y a un nombre important de connexion sur mon wiki par rapport à mon blog.</description>

      <description>Youhou quel titre ! Il y a quelques années, un de mes collègues avait cherché le moyen de faire de la réécriture d&amp;rsquo;URL (ce qui fonctionnait plutôt bien), mais sans cacher le numéro du port.
Pour toi public, voici donc la solution. Il faut tout simplement utiliser le module proxy d&amp;rsquo;Apache pour faire une réécriture d&amp;rsquo;URL. La documentation est ici.</description>

      <description>Je viens de commiter la version 0.2 de DeleteHistory qui est compatible avec MediaWiki 1.16.
Ça fait des mois que je suis en test chez moi, ça fonctionne plutôt bien. La semaine dernière j&amp;rsquo;ai reçu un mail d&amp;rsquo;un certain David qui me demandait une version qui fonctionnait sur MediaWiki 1.16.
Il l&amp;rsquo;a donc mis à jour avec succès et ça fonctionne très bien :-)
Pour ceux que ça intéresse, la dernière version est donc disponible sur mon git.</description>

      <description>Le TRIM permet de modifier le comportement de l’OS avec un disque SSD. Sur Mac OS X, aujourd’hui il n’y a que les SSD “Apple” qui ont cette techno. Le but de cette instruction est de maintenir la vitesse du SSD tout au long de sa vie, évitant le ralentissement que les premiers modèles rencontraient une fois que toutes les cellules étaient écrites au moins une fois.
Heureusement, d&amp;rsquo;autres gens s&amp;rsquo;y sont pencher pour l&amp;rsquo;activer sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel type de SSD.</description>

Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, je suis sous FreeBSD et je ne suis pas convaincu vu les bugs auxquels je me suis confronté (certainement du à l&amp;rsquo;émulation de couches basses Linux). Je me tourne donc vers ZFS on Linux.</description>

Vous connaissez déjà peut être Rancid qui permet de faire des backups de vos chers équipements Cisco et de les stocker dans un VCS. Au taf, mon équipe réseaux se plaignait de ne pas pouvoir faire de recherche dans tous les équipements cisco d&amp;rsquo;un coup. Imaginez plusieurs équipements avec pour certain plus de 25000 lignes d&amp;rsquo;ACL et autre configuration VPN.</description>

Il vous permet d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement des logiciels, faire leur configuration et changer l&amp;rsquo;état d&amp;rsquo;un service.
Je viens d&amp;rsquo;énumérer même pas 5% de ce que Puppet est capable de faire. Bref, j&amp;rsquo;avais déjà une doc sur mon wiki que je viens d&amp;rsquo;actualiser avec un peu plus d&amp;rsquo;explications et une version squeeze.</description>

      <description>Bonjour à tous !
J&amp;rsquo;ai mis à jour mon wiki avec ma configuration Nagios. Vous allez me dire : &amp;ldquo;Atta&amp;hellip; pouquoi t&amp;rsquo;fais ça, yen a plein sule net, c&amp;rsquo;est po la peine hein !&amp;rdquo;. C&amp;rsquo;est vrai qu&amp;rsquo;il y en a plein sur le net, c&amp;rsquo;est pour ça que la mienne n&amp;rsquo;est pas bourrée d&amp;rsquo;explications et surtout un peu plus particulière que la majorité qu&amp;rsquo;on trouve sur internet.
Etant utilisateur, administrateur et développeur de plugins, ma forte expérience sur Nagios m&amp;rsquo;a permit d&amp;rsquo;apprendre à moduler, simplifier et rendre flexible ma configuration Nagios.</description>

      <description>Ca fait un moment que ça me trotte dans la tête et voilà, je me suis décidé à mettre ceci en place.
Mon but est d&amp;rsquo;installer automatiquement les mises à jour de sécurité. Évidement il n&amp;rsquo;est pas vraiment recommandé de faire ce genre de chose, mais sur une Debian, qui est en version stable et ou seul les mise à jour de sécurité sont installées&amp;hellip; on limite les risques.
Je me suis donc mis à la recherche d&amp;rsquo;un outil permettant de faire de genre de choses et je suis tombé sur cron-apt.</description>

      <description>J’avais commencé à faire mon nouveau serveur avant de déménager, mais n’avais pas trop eu le temps d’en parler.
Pour être plus gentil avec la planète et avec mon compte en banque, j&amp;rsquo;ai décidé (idée de ma femme) de migrer mon serveur sur un Mac Mini.
Pourquoi ? Tout simplement parce que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas tant besoin de puissance que ça et qu&amp;rsquo;avec les Core 2 Duo qu&amp;rsquo;il y a dans l&amp;rsquo;avant dernière génération (celle que j&amp;rsquo;ai), en y ajoutant un peu de RAM (4Go au total) et un disque qui tient la route (500Go 7200trs/min), ça devrait tenir à l&amp;rsquo;aise le coup.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc écris une petite documentation sur GlusterFS sur comment répliquer le /var/www. Dans la pratique c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt bien :

Je connais bien les problématiques, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas toujours stable, c&amp;rsquo;est pauvre en options&amp;hellip;
Je possède une Soekris et j&amp;rsquo;en suis très content. Mais le fait d&amp;rsquo;avoir choisis OpenBSD est un choix personnel qui ne correspond pas vraiment à celui de mon ami car pas très user friendly.</description>

      <description>J&amp;rsquo;ai une très mauvaise expérience actuellement avec FreeBSD. J&amp;rsquo;ai effectuer plusieurs tests hard avant de remettre sur FreeBSD.
Pourquoi avais je pris FreeBSD au lieu de Debian ? :
 Pour le ZFS
 Sa réputation
 Pour essayer
  Seulement voilà, quand on commence à faire du fuse + encfs + sshfs&amp;hellip;bah c&amp;rsquo;est pas aussi stable qu&amp;rsquo;on est en droit de penser. J&amp;rsquo;ai des kernel panic qui ne font même pas rebooter ma machine (alors que c&amp;rsquo;est pourtant le comportement par défaut de FreeBSD) visiblement à cause de Fuse ou SSHfs et c&amp;rsquo;est très handicapant.</description>

http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/820-7197-12&amp;frasl;820-7197-12.pdf
Ensuite, un collègue m&amp;rsquo;a filé ce lien qui permet d&amp;rsquo;avoir les best practice pour faire du RAID 6 :
http://www.filibeto.org/sun/lib/blueprints/820-5825.pdf
Tout ça pour faire du vmware. Il a donc fallu changer le mode de visualisation de la baie par les hosts en vmware et idem encore utiliser les recommandations de Vmware par rapport aux LUN etc&amp;hellip; :</description>

      <description>Il semblerait que du côté de Debian 6 une nomenclature se fasse pour les interfaces réseaux évoluées. J&amp;rsquo;ai rencontré un problème avec mes interfaces bridgées qui n&amp;rsquo;utilisaient pas des noms &amp;ldquo;génériques&amp;rdquo;. En fait les scripts de base proposés par Debian comportent en dur des noms qu&amp;rsquo;il est préférable d&amp;rsquo;utiliser.

      <description>Que de mots pour le néophyte du ZFS. C’est en gros mon raidz2 (~ raid6) qui est parti en cacahuète à cause d’un disque pourave dont FreeBSD est également présent sur ce raid.
J&amp;rsquo;explique donc la marche à suivre pour remplacer son disque défectueux :-)</description>

      <description>En lisant mes flux RSS matinaux, je suis tombé sur un article parlant d’Easystroke. Le titre de l’article est “un logiciel de mouse gestures pour Linux”.
Mon coeur à a ce moment palpité, mais mon cerveau à eu quelques soupçons. Après tests, il s&amp;rsquo;avère que c&amp;rsquo;est tout simplement génial ! A peine 5 min que je suis dessus et je kiffe. Je cherchais tellement ce type de soft pour Thunderbird !</description>

      <title>Cache APT pour plusieurs serveurs debian</title>

      <description>N’ayant pas une connexion internet de dingue et utilisant des machines virtuelles, il devient vite pénible de devoir attendre 50 ans pour télécharger les même paquets pour toutes ces VMs. Donc j’ai cherché une solution pour avoir un espèce de cache spécialement pour apt.
J&amp;rsquo;ai trouvé mon bonheur avec apt-cacher-ng qui d&amp;rsquo;après ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai lu est la solution la plus aboutie aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui.
Pour la petite doc, ça se passe ici.</description>

      <description>Ca fait depuis un moment que je dois faire ça et ça y est. J’ai donc comme d’habitude, pondu une petite documentation qui explique comment on l’installe et le paramètre.
C&amp;rsquo;est vraiment une doc rapide sans trop d&amp;rsquo;explication. Cependant, je conseil plus que fortement de monitorer la base MySQL qui peut rapidement grandir et avoir besoin de tuning si jamais vous avez pas mal de checks.</description>

      <description>Je commence vraiment à utiliser collectd et il faut absolument une belle interface qui fait pas mal de trucs. Seulement voilà, le problème c’est que malgré qu’il y ai une 10 d’interfaces, elles sont toutes assez moche et peu fonctionnelle. Bref, il faut en utiliser plusieurs pour avoir un truc sympas.
Voici celles qui m&amp;rsquo;ont semblées intéressantes :
 Collection3  Interface simpliste, mais utile. C&amp;rsquo;est celle de base qui est plus ou moins recommandé par Collectd.</description>

      <description>Moi je connais un mec qui ce week end a fait un petit reboot (pour simplifier la situation) de son serveur qu’il a chez lui. En faisant le reboot 2 disques de sont raid 5 sont endommagés (1 qui fait clic clic et l’autre visiblement le problème de firmware Seagate….il avait pourtant flashé à l’époque pour ne pas que ça arrive).
Il essaye donc d&amp;rsquo;en faire repartir 1 et par miracle il y arrive.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;ai donc prévu une petite doc à cet effet pour ceux que ça intéresse. J&amp;rsquo;ai été aidé de Luc (un presta qui depuis a fait quelques commentaires sur le blog) et ai enrichi un peu le tout.</description>

      <description>J’ai récemment un nouveau contact (Luc) (qui a posé un commentaire hier d’ailleurs :-)) qui m’a fait découvrir les certificats SSL gratuit. Même si ça a quelques contraintes de confidentialités, on peut générer de vrais certificats SSL reconnu nativement (dans la liste des autorités de certification) sur tout bon browser web qui se respecte.
Il y a plusieurs niveau, gratuits et payant. Le niveau gratuit permet de faire déjà pas mal de trucs, je vous laisse consulter ma doc si vous voulez faire de même et le site (StarCom) si vous voulez en savoir plus.</description>

      <description>Suite à un précédent post, c’est super de faire des schéma en ASCII, mais des fois on aimerait bien les avoir en version un peu plus propre. On va donc éviter de tout refaire hein :-) ! Et c’est là que Ditaa entre en jeu ! Il est écrit en java et permet simplement une conversion. Voici l’exemple d’un schéma ASCII :

      <description>Je suis en train de revoir mon archi à la maison pour me faire un NAS multimédia qui tournerait sur FreeBSD. J’ai donc pour le moment besoin d’un bon RAID qui tourne bien et vu qu’il y a ZFS sur FreeBSD, ça tombe bien.
J&amp;rsquo;ai pour l&amp;rsquo;instant fait une petite doc (qui est plus que très proche de la doc officielle tellement elle est bien faite) qui résume comment s&amp;rsquo;y prendre pour faire booter son FreeBSD sur du RAIDZ.</description>

      <description>J’ai eu une petite mésaventure depuis quelques mois au taf avec ce merveilleux filesystem qu’est ZFS. Le problème est simple, j’ai des machines à 72Go de RAM et ne peut dépasser ~ les 48Go.
Comment ça se fait ? Tout simplement parce que ZFS se réserve 1&amp;frasl;8 de la mémoire dispo (RAM+SWAP) pour son cache. Sur des petites config ça ne se voit pas mais sur des machines avec autant de RAM, ça ait mal.</description>

C&amp;rsquo;est buggé a mort. Tous les outils de diagnostiques disent que tout fonctionne, et pourtant, aucuns mails relayé. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc fait une petite doc avec tous les prérequis, les check à faire&amp;hellip;
Pour ma part, tous les checks disaient que tout fonctionnaient bien mais il m&amp;rsquo;a fallu appliquer un Service Pack pour que tout refonctionne.</description>

      <description>Encore une fois, ça a été la tannée avec ce Packet Filter ! Ils changent tout le temps pas mal de trucs. Mon serveur était donc inaccessible cette nuit à cause de cette upgrade.
J&amp;rsquo;ai déjà encore galérer pour foutre ce putain de PXE. J&amp;rsquo;ai pourtant suivit ma doc que j&amp;rsquo;avais faite précédemment, mais là, rien à faire, le PXE ne voulait pas être reconnu. J&amp;rsquo;ai donc décider d&amp;rsquo;en faire un sous OpenBSD (OpenBSD pour installer OpenBSD, quoi de plus naturelle&amp;hellip;) et vais améliorer la doc ici.</description>

      <description>SSLH est comme un tour de magie. Il permet par exemple sur une adresse WAN sur le port 443 d’avoir du HTTPS et du SSH. Comment c’est possible ??? On peut mettre un même port d’écoute sur un même port !
Effectivement ! Il faut simplement voir SSLH comme un proxy de couche 7 capable de filtrer et différencier les trames SSL des trames SSH.
Et voici une petite documentation et un correctif pour OpenBSD.</description>

Voilà donc un plugin qui permet de parser un fichier, et de garder ou non les lignes qui nous intéressent. En plus de celà on peut spécifier, s&amp;rsquo;il faut un certain nombre de lignes pour que le plugin retourne une valeur positive.</description>

C’est un soft qui me permettait d’être (entre autre car il a beaucoup plus de fonctionnalités que ça) connecté avec mon téléphone portable en bluetooth à mon mac et lorsque je m’éloignais, l’ordi se vérouillait.
Je regrette que cette fonctionnalité là n&amp;rsquo;existe pas sur Linux.</description>

Puis je me suis souvenu que le HTML 5 arrivait à grand pas et qu&amp;rsquo;il y avait un support video. Je me suis donc penché un peu plus sur la question et voilà ce que je trouver : 2 formats existent pour le moment OGV (Libre et gratuit) et H264 (Payant à l&amp;rsquo;utilisation, mais vu que je suis un particulier etc&amp;hellip; personne ira vérifier, surtout pour des videos perso).</description>

J’ai été très étonné par la simplicité de la configuration par rapport à Apache qui au fil du temps est devenu une grosse usine à gaz. Avec Lighttpd, ils deviennent des alternatives vraiment sérieuses à Apache avec surtout les performances et optimisation des ressources nettement meilleures.</description>

      <description>Dans un précédent post, j’expliquais comment faire des exe sous Windows. Je vais donc expliquer pourquoi :
Dans ma boite, j&amp;rsquo;ai des personnes mal intentionnées qui avaient les droits admin de leur machine. Le problème c&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;avec ça ils peuvent en faire des conneries&amp;hellip;
Pour palier à ce problème, on les a mis en utilisateurs. Et pour ne pas que si quelqu&amp;rsquo;un trouve le mot de passe admin, qu&amp;rsquo;il puisse se connecter sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel ordinateur pour prendre des informations, il faut un mot de passe unique par ordinateur.</description>

Le portage de Perl sur Windows est vraiment très bien fait et ça fonctionne quasiment pareil que sur les *nix. Biensure, il y a quelques petites différences comme les chemins des dossiers etc…, mais franchement, du fait qu’on puisse utiliser les API Windows, c’est vraiment balaise.</description>

      <description>Ca fait des semaines que Steeves me parles de Google Chrome, qu’il me dit qu’il faut que j’y passe etc… Perso, je suis très content de mon firefox. Si il pouvait être un peut plus rapide, j’aimerais bien aussi.
Donc voilà Chrome est sensé faire tout ce que fait Firefox, mais en mieux. Un peu septique, j&amp;rsquo;ai tout de même voulu tenter l&amp;rsquo;aventure.
Mon bilan est dressé au bout d&amp;rsquo;une heure d&amp;rsquo;utilisation.</description>

      <title>RRDtool : Oh qu’ils sont beaux les graphs</title>

      <description>Depuis quelques temps je me suis mis à faire toute sorte de graphs. Vous l’avez vu dans un de mes précédents posts avec OpenChart et maintenant RRDtool. Je ne vous cacherais pas que c’est un peu complexe a prendre en main, mais une fois fait, on peut vraiment tout faire et on comprends aisément pourquoi il est utilisé partout.
Le mécanisme de base de donnée est extrêment bien pensé et surtout autonome, ce qui le rends très pratique et facile anticiper les éventuels problèmes de place liés à de multiples bases de données RRD (puisque maitrisée).</description>

      <description>Bon, le titre est pas génial je sais, mais pas évident d’expliquer. Plowshare est un outil en ligne de commande permettant de télécharger tout type de fichiers sur les sites tel que rapidshare ou megaupload sans avoir à se prendre la tête. On lui balance les liens et ça roule.

Je copie donc mon contenu à l&amp;rsquo;arrache en me disant que la PS3 va automatiquement détecter en fonction des extensions des fichiers si c&amp;rsquo;est des photos, musiques ou films&amp;hellip;et bah non ! Quedal ! Ca marche pas vraiment comme ça. Réencoder les films ?</description>

Bref heureusement j&amp;rsquo;ai un raid 5 sur 4 disques et je n&amp;rsquo;ai qu&amp;rsquo;1 disque qui est tombé en panne. C&amp;rsquo;est donc arrivé samedi et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc racheté un disque Seagate (pas que j&amp;rsquo;aime me faire du mal, mais la série de disques défectueux est passée et en plus je trouve que les Seagate sont très très bon pour tourner 24/24h.</description>

 check_sun_cluster : qui permet de surveiller l&amp;rsquo;état du cluster sun check_multi_procs : permet de surveiller plusieurs process dans un seul check  Et puis j&amp;rsquo;ai pu en améliorer d&amp;rsquo;autres :
 check_backuppc_hosts : ajout d&amp;rsquo;une fonctionnalité pour monitorer qu&amp;rsquo;un seuil hôte  Voilà donc mes dernières œuvres.</description>

      <description>Je pense avoir trouvé le plugin Eclipse qu’il me fallait. Il utilise en fait gvim. Mon problème était donc d’adapter gvim pour qu’il puisse utiliser ma conf de vim. Tout ne passait pas correctement, j’ai donc adapter comme il fallait mon .vimrc afin qu’il se rapproche au mieux de vim.
Il faut donc installer le plugin à l&amp;rsquo;adresse suivante : http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/.
Un une fois installé, il faut l&amp;rsquo;activer dans les préférences gvim, puis l&amp;rsquo;associer aux extensions de fichier souhaité.</description>

      <description>Sur les conseils de mon ami Seb (Teka), je me suis mis à utiliser un IDE pour développer dans toute sorte de language afin de gagner en souplesse et en rapidité.
Du coup, j&amp;rsquo;utilise Eclipse. Cependant, de base, il n&amp;rsquo;y a pas grand chose qui m&amp;rsquo;intéresse puisque c&amp;rsquo;est assez spécifique à Java et je ne développe pas en Java. Il existe donc tout un tas d&amp;rsquo;addons et j&amp;rsquo;ai donc mis sur mon wiki ceux que j&amp;rsquo;utilise.</description>

J’ai voulu upgrader comme j’avais fait à l’époque de la 4.4 vers la 4.5, à savoir en mode manuel http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade46.html#upgrade.
Même si il est clairement spécifier que ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas la méthode recommandée, je n&amp;rsquo;avais pas rencontrer de problèmes la fois d&amp;rsquo;avant.</description>

Ca donne quand même une belle doc du fait que la complexité de la chose. En effet, pas de grande similitudes avec les ACL Linux pour le côté utilisation, parcontre dans les faits, le système est assez similaire.</description>

 Solaris
 MySQL
 SPARC
  MySQL, j&amp;rsquo;y croyais pas du tout, mais c&amp;rsquo;est super, je suis content. J&amp;rsquo;espère qu&amp;rsquo;xVM Server va également sortir rapidement en stable etc&amp;hellip; Je trouve parcontre vraiment dommage qu&amp;rsquo;ils abandonnent OpenSolaris. C&amp;rsquo;était, je pense, une très bonne solution pour améliorer la stabilité de leurs produits finaux et intéresser un plus large publique bien que Solaris soit aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui gratuit.</description>

      <description>François un de mes collègues, m’a apprit aujourd’hui que Heartbeat n’était plus maintenu depuis l’année dernière et qu’ils avaient décidés de merger avec Pacemaker pour avoir un produit encore plus abouti.
Pacemaker est en fait un espèce de Heartbeat 3 (trouvé sur la doc officelle) avec comme framework OpenAIS qui est en fait une librairie pouvant être appellée via API. Un peu à la manière de KVM/Xen et libvirt.
C&amp;rsquo;est donc une mode et ça nous replonge encore dans du temps passer à lire et lire des docs.</description>

 Et enfin le multi calendriers (http://m.google.com/sync et mettre la langue en Anglais US, choisissez ensuite les calendriers que vous souhaiter activer (jusqu&amp;rsquo;a 25 :-)))
  Et là, tu kiffes à mort !</description>

      <title>Pourquoi Solaris n’améliore pas sa gestion des packages bordel ?!</title>

      <description>Solaris est super évolué sur certaines technos, mais alors sur certains trucs comme les packages, c’est une horreur ! Exemple :
 Très mauvaise gestion des dépendances
 Pas de repository (je parle en natif, sinon il existe pkgget)
 Pas d&amp;rsquo;utilisation simple
  Bref, un bon coup de pied au cul leur ferait pas de mal à Sun. Espérons que le rachat par Oracle améliorera les points archaïque qui mette à ce bel OS des coups de freins à tous ceux qui voudraient l&amp;rsquo;utiliser.</description>

      <description>Google tasks, c’est nouveau, c’est beau et c’est il n’existe pas encore grand chose pour le faire tourner dans une appli tel que Lightning (Thunderbird). C’est pourquoi il faut ruser et utiliser Mozilla Prism et Alltray. Je vous laisse ma doc qui je l’espère vous aidera :

      <description>Vous devriez voir une nette différence avec mon blog sous memcached. Le wiki y est depuis déjà quelques années, mais le blog non car il n’y avait pas vraiment de possibilités durant l’installation ou avec les extensions actuelle.
J&amp;rsquo;ai réussi à mettre la main sur cet arcticle qui me permet de pondre une documentation assez complète sur la mise en place de memcached sur WordPress.
Alors, trouvez vous le blog plus rapide ?</description>

 Par open relay
 Par open proxy
 Par modification de clef SSH
  Il nous revient avec un nouveau challenge ! Steeves is back ! Mais pas complètement de sa faute cette fois. Disons qu&amp;rsquo;un de ses potes n&amp;rsquo;a apparemment pas de notions de développement sécurisé.</description>

Pour résumer c&amp;rsquo;est un mec qui se plaint d&amp;rsquo;un soit disant bug sur Debian et qui envoie via reportbug son soucis avec un minimum d&amp;rsquo;infos. La personne du support lui en demande plus et quelques messages plus tard, l&amp;rsquo;utilisateur dit :
 THAT&amp;rsquo;S ALL THE INFO I GOT FROM THE FUCKING SOFTWARE!

J&amp;rsquo;ai le truc qu&amp;rsquo;il vous faut, c&amp;rsquo;est en flash, ça génère des graphs trop classe, bref le kiffe. Ca s&amp;rsquo;appelle Open Flash Chart. Le nom est pas très originale certe, mais au moins ça a le mérite d&amp;rsquo;être beau et efficace.

Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas ça fait de la colorisation syntaxique sur pas mal de différents codes.

Je vous suggère, si vous savez comment fonctionne un cluster de lire ma doc si c&amp;rsquo;est la première fois que vous faites une install, car il faut se tirer les cheveux quelques fois avant d&amp;rsquo;arriver à faire une installe propre par rapport aux exigences de Sun.</description>

Mon précédent post parlait de l&amp;rsquo;environnement et du film Home qui m&amp;rsquo;a déclenché l&amp;rsquo;envie d&amp;rsquo;accélérer un projet que j&amp;rsquo;ai commencé il y a quelques mois maintenant appellé phpWOL (php Wake On Lan).
Je vais le continuer en partenaria avec Teka (Sébastien), mon ami avec qui je fais MySecureShell également afin d&amp;rsquo;accélérer son développement.
phpWOL a pour but de démarrer des machines à distance.</description>

Et franchement entre la musique de ses Sims (dont la maison prenait feu) et le serveur, j’avais du mal à distinguer le bruit du serveur tellement c’était la première fois que j’entendais ce bruit là.
Une fois le son des Sims coupés (:-p) j&amp;rsquo;étais ennuyé parce que le bruit ne me disait vraiment pas grand chose.</description>

Ce matin en lisant mes news google reader habituelles, c&amp;rsquo;est howtoforge qui nous pond un article sur l&amp;rsquo;ATA Over Ethernet. Je trouvais que le nom sonnait bien.
Je commence à faire quelques petites recherches, déjà la mise en place parait relativement aisée, plutôt bon point, cependant, le débit n&amp;rsquo;a pas l&amp;rsquo;air délirant et apparemment il existe quelques petits problèmes de rapidité (certainement dû à la jeunesse) pour le moment.</description>

Malheureusement, je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas de preuves pour affirmer ce que je dis plus haut, mais c&amp;rsquo;est plutôt l&amp;rsquo;experience que j&amp;rsquo;ai avec les images disques qui me faire dire ça.</description>

Chaque chose en son temps ! D&amp;rsquo;abord ca a été Nagios pour lui, et maintenant on aperçoit le bout du nez de Centreon.

 Mis en place en * de 2 min
 Mise à dispo d&amp;rsquo;une interface web belle et simple
 Pleins de protocoles intégrés
 Légère
  Ca me donne envie de me faire un PC et de dédier à ça (émuler une baie de stockage quoi).
Il y a une autre solution vieillissante aparement aussi (j&amp;rsquo;ai pas testé) qui s&amp;rsquo;appelle OpenFiler qui a l&amp;rsquo;air d&amp;rsquo;être dans le même goût mais avec une documentation payante (un peu la blague).</description>

      <description>Suite à mon précédent post sur le versionning, j’ai donc décidé en mon âme et conscience, de choisir Git.
Je dois avoué que je suis assez surpris par les nouvelles fonctionnalités qui changent un peu de SVN, mais c&amp;rsquo;est quand même vraiment pas mal !
J&amp;rsquo;entends la foule crier au loin &amp;ldquo;la doc, la doc&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, oui oui elle est là et prête : Doc sur Git
Ouali oulaou, que ceux qu&amp;rsquo;on des questions n&amp;rsquo;aysyttepeua !</description>

      <description>Je suis tiraillé entre plusieurs trucs. J’aimerais mettre un soft de versionning pour tout ce que je développe. Seulement voilà, je ne sais pas bien quoi mettre au juste :
 CVS : vieux, plus vraiment mis à jour, mais standart
 SVN : plus récent, plus performant que CVS mais qui commence déjà à vieillir, mais standart aussi
 Git : encore plus récent, plus performant, moins gourmand en disque qu&amp;rsquo;SVN ?</description>

      <description>Et bien ça y est ! J’ai essayé et ça marche ! Trop content !!!!!
KVM et MediaTomb ça rox et très très bien en plus. J&amp;rsquo;ai pas encore essayé avec des videos Full HD (c&amp;rsquo;est un peu ce qui m&amp;rsquo;intéresse aussi) mais en attendant, ça claque !
Pour la doc, ça se passe ici.

      <description>Voici ma nouvelle contribution pour Nagios :
 Pour tester vos interfaces IPMP
 Pour tester votre multipathing (utile pour les liens Fibres sur les SAN)
  J&amp;rsquo;espère que ces premières versions vont plaires. Le check de Backuppc a déjà pas mal de downloads :-)</description>

  Pour ce qui est de Lighttpd, je rajouterais au fur et à mesure mes ajouts. Mais qu&amp;rsquo;est-ce que c&amp;rsquo;est kiffant putain ! La conf à la perl, les correspondances, les regex, la simplicité ouaaa trop bien !</description>

      <description>Bon… allez, je vais vous expliquer déjà pourquoi j’ai refais mon serveur.
Dans mes précédents posts datant du mois de décembre, vous avez pu lire que j&amp;rsquo;étais passé de mon serveur Debian 32 bits etch (stable de l&amp;rsquo;époque) vers Solaris et adoptant la virtualisation avec VirtualBox le temps de patienter pour xVM Server.
Aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui, xVM Server n&amp;rsquo;est toujours pas sorti, VirtualBox n&amp;rsquo;est vraiment, vraiment pas fait pour de la pseudo prod (donc imaginez la prod), contrairement à ce qui est dit sur le site officiel de Sun.</description>

      <description>Et voilà, je contribue. C’est rare car je n’ai pas toujours le temps de faire quelque chose de générique, mais là c’est le cas, donc j’en fais profiter tout le monde.
J&amp;rsquo;ai développer un plugins Nagios pour checker l&amp;rsquo;état de bon fonctionnement de BackupPC. J&amp;rsquo;ai fais avec les moyens du bord et je suis sûr qu&amp;rsquo;il y a moyen de faire plus simple.
En attendant, voici le lien : http://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Backup-and-Recovery/BackupPC/check_backuppc_hosts/details</description>

      <description>Bon là ça y est, j’en peux plus !
Je viens de vendre mon mac par exemple et voici ce que j&amp;rsquo;ai comme problèmes :
 Les transferts en SSH déconnent (s&amp;rsquo;arrête au bout d&amp;rsquo;un certain temps) avec Cyberduck.
 Sur le serveur, j&amp;rsquo;ai une clef USB branchée dessus, c&amp;rsquo;est ultra lent pour copier un truc.
 Aucunes souplesses avec Solaris.
  Donc voilà, ça y est, ça fait un moment que j&amp;rsquo;en parle, il me faut du temps pour refaire mon serveur là.</description>

J&amp;rsquo;essaye de pondre un article aussi bien foutut que pour Perl, enfin je le prépare parceque je suis en vacances quand même. Geek, mais pas trop.</description>

      <description>Ca y est, méga gavage entre Solaris et VirtualBox. Entre :
 Les pertes de perfs réseaux
 Les problèmes de paravirtualisation VT sous VirtualBox
 Les perfs en générale
  J&amp;rsquo;en peux plus. C&amp;rsquo;est super décourageant. Alors maintenant on va se poser les vrais questions :
 OS : Debian 5, ya pas à tortiller du cul pour chier droit

      <description>Bon, j’arrête pas de lire et d’entendre : “Pourquoi t’utilises pas Ubuntu ? C’est Debian mais avec des paquets à jour !”
Alors pour pas mourrir con, j&amp;rsquo;me suis dis allez, pourquoi ne pas tenter l&amp;rsquo;aventure (c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;heure de Koh-Lanta c&amp;rsquo;est pour ça que cette expression me vient) et je l&amp;rsquo;ai (comme décrit dans un précédent post) installé en VM sur mon serveur et c&amp;rsquo;est là dessus que tourne actuellement mon serveur de mails ainsi que le serveur web.</description>

      <description>J’ai reçu ma bébete mercredi ainsi que ma carte Compact Flash.
J&amp;rsquo;ai donc tout installé dans la boiboite et après une soirée de beuverie pour le nouvel an et 5h de sommeil, je me suis dis qu&amp;rsquo;il était temps d&amp;rsquo;installer le monstre. Sur les conseils de David qui m&amp;rsquo;a fournit les &amp;ldquo;soit disant bons&amp;rdquo; cables pour connecter la Soekris à mon PC, il aurait été normal que je le remercie, mais là nan !</description>

 Mise à dispo de VMs à Seb et Stival pour tous les tests Cluster HA

 Passage de 2To de données en single HDD à 3To en raid5
 Migration Debian etch 32 bits vers Solaris x86_64
 Mise en place de VMs :
 OpenBSD 4.4
 Debian (ou ubuntu server, je ne sais pas trop encore)
  Il y aura donc des perturbations pendant quelques jours, voir toute la semaine prochaine. Je vous tiens au courant de l&amp;rsquo;évolution&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>J’ai enfin terminé de rédiger mon Introduction à Perl.
J&amp;rsquo;ai commencé à lire le bouquin été 2007, ai dans la foulée commencé à rédiger ce concentré. Bon évidement j&amp;rsquo;ai commencé d&amp;rsquo;autres bouquins tel que le PHP sur lequel je dois finir d&amp;rsquo;écrire également le résumer sur mon wiki. Je serais pas obligé de faire tout ça si la partie de mon cerveau qui stock les informations était un disque dur indexé de plusieurs Go.</description>
