      <description>For another personal project (that I can&amp;rsquo;t talk about for the moment ;-)), I wanted to have a Changelog file to get a better following of the infrastructure evolution (configuration management, scripts&amp;hellip;all under git). Of course the documentation is very important, but when you do not write it at the same time you&amp;rsquo;re building the infrastructure, it may be complex to remember each little things you&amp;rsquo;ve done. That&amp;rsquo;s why a Changelog can help to understand how the infrastructure has been built step by step.</description>

      <description>A lot of time, I had to modify the text of my commit since I&amp;rsquo;m using a versionning system. Modifying the last commit comment is something common:
git commit --amend However, modifying the date is not so common. You may want to do it for several reasons (stats or similar), here is how to:
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE=&amp;#34;`date`&amp;#34; git commit --amend --date &amp;#34;`date`&amp;#34; This will change the last commit with the current date.</description>

      <description>Merging from one branch to another branch is something common with Git. I had to do it several times and recently I had to make a big one. I&amp;rsquo;ve just never took the time to look at what exist to make faster merge and how to use it.
After some researches, I found git mergetool which will use VIM (by default on my laptop) to have a better view on what I have to do, to merge my files.</description>

      <title>ReadTheDocs: a hosting documentation solution with GitHub</title>

      <description>I recently talked about Sphinxdoc and we wanted (still for MySecureShell project) a solution to host our documentation. ReadTheDocs is a very good, free and pretty solution made for Sphinxdoc :-)
What we liked in addition of the hosting, is the usage with GitHub. You can configure a webhook to your GitHub account to automatically ask ReadTheDocs to build a newer version each time a commit is pushed on your GitHub account.</description>
