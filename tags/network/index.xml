      <description>WireGuard is a very good alternative to OpenVPN. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using OpenVPN for more than 10 years now and I was happy until I understood how slow it can be on low energy devices like EdgeRouter.
To give you an idea, on my Fiber Home connection (200Mbps), I&amp;rsquo;m limited to 18Mbps. With OpenVPN, I&amp;rsquo;m reaching the maximum CPU usage on the EdgeRouter. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of WireGuard about a year now and it was time for me to test this interresting alternative.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter PoE since several years now and really like it. Fanless, small, running on Debian (unfortunately not really up to date) and powerful.
However I recently had issues with the disk. Simply dead and obviously a reboot didn&amp;rsquo;t repaired it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching solutions on the official forum to replace the disk and I was surprised about the fact it runs on a simple USB stick. I decided to replace it with a Kingston one:</description>
