Visualy there is a big change and technically it&amp;rsquo;s the same.
I was fed up about maintaining Wordpress with its stack (Nginx / php-fpm / MariaDB) for a mostly static blog. I was thinking about migrating from Wordpress to something in markdown since several years but didn&amp;rsquo;t know exactly which solution I wanted to choose. I really enjoyed using Wordpress but wanted to keep hands on my blog and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to switch to full hosted Wordpress because of its limitations (image size etc&amp;hellip;).</description></item><item><title>ReadTheDocs: a hosting documentation solution with GitHub</title><link>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/09/26/readthedocs-a-hosting-documentation-solution-with-github/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Sep 2014 10:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.deimos.fr/2014/09/26/readthedocs-a-hosting-documentation-solution-with-github/</guid><description>I recently talked about Sphinxdoc and we wanted (still for MySecureShell project) a solution to host our documentation. ReadTheDocs is a very good, free and pretty solution made for Sphinxdoc :-)
What we liked in addition of the hosting, is the usage with GitHub. You can configure a webhook to your GitHub account to automatically ask ReadTheDocs to build a newer version each time a commit is pushed on your GitHub account.</description></item></channel></rss>
